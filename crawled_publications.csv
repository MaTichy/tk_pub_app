            The insider threat is often cited as one of the most challenging threats for security practitioners. Even though this topic is receiving considerable attention, two main problems remain unsolved. First, research on
            <jats:italic>insider threats</jats:italic>
            is focusing on many different
            <jats:italic>insiders</jats:italic>
            without being able to actually identify and consistently entitle the key aspects of the insiders. As a result, this research can neither be identified by practitioners as being relevant for their real-world insider problems, nor can it be compared with other research targeting the same insider aspects. Second, a clear understanding of
            <jats:italic>insiders</jats:italic>
            is vital for analysing, which insider properties are responsible for the peculiarity of
            <jats:italic>insider threats</jats:italic>
            . In this article, a systematic approach to dissect the defining aspects of
            <jats:italic>insiders</jats:italic>
            is proposed, which includes specific allocatable insider characteristics. Additionally, the insider characteristics are extended toward insider types, which establish universal and unambiguous names for different insiders and which are related with each other to form a new and simple
            <jats:italic>insider taxonomy</jats:italic>
            . The new foundations on insiders allow the comparison of different insider research in a structured manner. Furthermore, the new approach facilitates the identification of specific features of insider threats in future work.

The Internet of Things and sensor systems, which enable smart environments and services, are settings where deep learning can provide invaluable utility. However, the data in these systems are very often directly or indirectly related to people, which raises privacy concerns. Federated learning (FL) mitigates some of these concerns and empowers deep learning in sensor-driven environments by enabling multiple entities to collaboratively train a machine learning model without sharing their data. Nevertheless, a number of works in the literature propose attacks that can manipulate the model and disclose information about the training data in FL. As a result, there has been a growing belief that FL is highly vulnerable to severe attacks. Although these attacks do indeed highlight security and privacy risks in FL, some of them may not be as effective in production deployment because they are feasible only given special—sometimes impractical—assumptions. In this paper, we investigate this issue by conducting a quantitative analysis of the attacks against FL and their evaluation settings in 48 papers. This analysis is the first of its kind to reveal several research gaps with regard to the types and architectures of target models. Additionally, the quantitative analysis allows us to highlight unrealistic assumptions in some attacks related to the hyper-parameters of the model and data distribution. Furthermore, we identify fallacies in the evaluation of attacks which raise questions about the generalizability of the conclusions. As a remedy, we propose a set of recommendations to promote adequate evaluations.</jats:p>",1424-8220,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s23010031,journal-article,en,31,23,1,,2022-12-20,134,,journal-article,10.3390/s23010031

However, the sensitive nature of medical data poses privacy and security challenges. The primary concern is the risk of de-anonymization, where users can be linked to their donated data through background knowledge or communication metadata. In this paper, we introduce Anonify, a decentralized anonymity protocol offering strong user protection during data donation without reliance on a single entity. It achieves dual-level anonymity protection, covering both communication and data aspects by leveraging Distributed Point Functions, and incorporating k-anonymity and stratified sampling within a secret-sharing-based setting. Anonify ensures that the donated data is in a form that affords flexibility for researchers in their analyses. Our evaluation demonstrates the efficiency of Anonify in preserving privacy and optimizing data utility. Furthermore, the performance of machine learning algorithms on the anonymized datasets generated by the protocol shows high accuracy and precision.</jats:p>",2299-0984,,http://dx.doi.org/10.56553/popets-2024-0069,journal-article,,94-108,2024,3,,2024-7,0,,journal-article,10.56553/popets-2024-0069
