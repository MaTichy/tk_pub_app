        abstract = {The rise of deep learning has led to various successful attempts to apply deep neural networks (DNNs) for important networking tasks such as intrusion detection. Yet, running DNNs in the network control plane, as typically done in existing proposals, suffers from high latency that impedes the practicality of such approaches. This paper introduces NetNN, a novel DNN-based intrusion detection system that runs completely in the network data plane to achieve low latency. NetNN adopts raw packet information as input, avoiding complicated feature engineering. NetNN mimics the DNN dataflow execution by mapping DNN parts to a network of programmable switches, executing partial DNN computations on individual switches, and generating packets carrying intermediate execution results between these switches. We implement NetNN in P4 and demonstrate the feasibility of such an approach. Experimental results show that NetNN can improve the intrusion detection accuracy to 99{$\backslash$}\% while meeting the real-time requirement.}

This paper presents Sponge, a novel deep learning inference serving system that maximizes resource efficiency while guaranteeing dynamic SLOs. Sponge achieves its goal by applying in-place vertical scaling, dynamic batching, and request reordering. Specifically, we introduce an Integer Programming formulation to capture the resource allocation problem, providing a mathematical model of the relationship between latency, batch size, and resources.

To simplify the ex- ploration of the vast and intricate trade-off space of latency, accuracy, and cost in inference pipelines, providers frequently opt to consider one of them. However, the challenge lies in reconciling latency, accuracy, and cost trade-offs. To address this challenge and propose a solution to efficiently manage model variants in inference pipelines, we present IPA, an on- line deep learning Inference Pipeline Adaptation system that efficiently leverages model variants for each deep learning task. Model variants are different versions of pre-trained mod- els for the same deep learning task with variations in resource requirements, latency, and accuracy. IPA dynamically config- ures batch size, replication, and model variants to optimize accuracy, minimize costs, and meet user-defined latency Ser- vice Level Agreements (SLAs) using Integer Programming. It supports multi-objective settings for achieving different trade-offs between accuracy and cost objectives while re- maining adaptable to varying workloads and dynamic traffic patterns. Navigating a wider variety of configurations allows IPA to achieve better trade-offs between cost and accuracy objectives compared to existing methods. Extensive experi- ments in a Kubernetes implementation with five real-world inference pipelines demonstrate that IPA improves end-to- end accuracy by up to 21\% with a minimal cost increase.},

        abstract = {Botnets allow cybercriminals to conduct crippling Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, distribute ransomware, and perform many other attacks. To mitigate the damage from botnet attacks, defenders observe and record botnet traffic in a process called botnet tracking. Defenders use the gathered information to take down the botnet itself or defend against attacks originating from the botnet. Botnet tracking measurements typically rely on IP addresses as identifiers of infected devices. This reliance on IP addresses is problematic, as Internet Service Providers (ISPs) frequently reassign IP addresses to different users. Furthermore, multiple devices may share a single public IP address due to the shortage of IP addresses. The lack of unique and long-term identifiers plagues botnet measurements with uncertainty. Furthermore, IP addresses are commonly considered Personally Identifiable Information (PII), raising privacy-related concerns about the lawfulness of collecting and processing botnet tracking data. In this thesis, we make four contributions that allow us to conduct more accurate botnet measurements based on IP addresses and improve our understanding of the quality and limitations of these measurements.  First, we introduce a novel approach for estimating a botnet?s size, called Considering Address Reassignment Duration when Counting (CARDCount). State-of-the-art approaches rely on counting unique IP addresses, leading to inaccurate estimates due to bots being assigned multiple IP addresses over time. The idea of CARDCount is to use statistical distributions of IP address assignments to account for multiple IP address assignments. We show that CARDCount provides substantially more accurate estimates than the state-of-the-art in several real-world evaluations.  Second, we describe a measurement study that we conducted to analyze modern IoT botnets? (dis-)similarities. For that, we implemented a novel system to uniformly and collaboratively measure multiple botnets. In an eight-month measurement study, we found that modern IoT botnets strongly deviate in their characteristics. We used the IP addresses to group bots based on their AS and country to identify possible reasons for the deviations. This grouping allowed us to identify the influence of demographics on a bot?s lifetime, churn, and response behavior. These findings show that modern IoT botnets evolved from the once canonical IoT botnet Mirai. Furthermore, the differences in demographics highlight that not all bots provide the same utility, e.g., the availability to conduct DDoS attack. Therefore, in addition to size, one should consider a botnet?s demographics and the resulting impact on bot lifetime, availability, and responsiveness.  Third, we conducted simulations to investigate the recent development of anti-tracking mechanisms and their impact on botnet tracking operations. We assumed a worst-case scenario where botmasters could detect any deviation from regular bot behavior. For our evaluation, we developed a purpose-built botnet simulation framework to simulate thousands of possible scenarios and configurations. We found that anti-tracking mechanisms can require a hundredfold increase in available IP addresses to track a botnet successfully. However, developing distributed and collaborative tracking mechanisms could reduce the resource requirements of defenders.  Fourth, we address the interdisciplinary question of the lawfulness of botnet tracking under the GDPR. We established that the GDPR does apply to botnet tracking. Furthermore, we identified legal grounds for botnet tracking conducted by industry, ISPs, and research in the public interest. We found that research in the public interest is most flexible, while ISPs are most restricted concerning the techniques used to conduct and data collected during botnet tracking. Furthermore, we provided practical guidelines for each party to minimize the possible impact on the privacy of an infected device?s owner.  Overall, this thesis makes several contributions that improve our understanding of botnet measurements based on IP addresses and our capabilities to perform more accurate measurements.  While in parts of our work, we focused on current threats (Hajime, Mirai, and Mozi botnets), we consistently aimed to make our contributions as general as possible to make them applicable to future botnets. Ultimately, the tools and insights presented in this thesis provide defenders with an edge in the fight against botnets now and in the future.},

However, determining the Quality of Result (QoR) for each operation in a service chain ahead of time, as is the state of the art, cannot prevent requests that are currently processing from being late if resource availability changes, e.g., due to resource sharing at inelastic Edge sites. Therefore, we present a framework to control the QoR online by replanning QoR values whenever resource changes are detected.},

Yet, to date, systems providing thermal feedback were primarily designed for the upper body, targeting hands and arms in particular. As these parts are often occupied with other tasks, there is a need to extend the design space of thermal feedback to other body parts. To close this gap, we assess thermal feedback on the user?s feet. This research explores if creating stimuli representing any direction on a circle with only four actuators is possible. To evaluate this concept, we conducted a user study asking the participants to indicate the perceived direction after getting a hot or cold stimulus by direct actuation using one actuator or phantom actuation using two actuators. The results indicate that the detection accuracy was higher for cold signals. In addition, the results showed higher recognition for stimuli linked to actuator distribution than phantom sensation due to spatial summation.}

Not only for legitimate purposes are these digital tools used, but also groups of extremists and terrorist organizations take advantage of the features of these platforms to spread radicalization, propaganda, brainwashing and for online recruitment. Recent studies, conducted in this area, are trying to face with this phenomenon, but due to the heterogeneity of the sources, the large amount of daily data generated, and especially the different levels of radicalization of the users, make it even more difficult to define effective and general countermeasures against such phenomenon. In this context, the paper provides a solution that not only aims to support the detection of terrorist propaganda (and related users), but also to support its further categorization, centered on a pyramid classification model, by analyzing the level of users? radicalization. This approach has two fundamental complementary advantages, as on the one hand it enables the establishment of priorities in terms of intervention, and on the other hand to define and apply targeted countermeasures based on the level of user?s radicalization. The proposed model and the results obtained from its experimentation are shown and discussed in comparison to previous works.}

A raising discussion in the research community suggests that FedAvg might not be the optimal method since, for instance, it does not fully take into account the variety of the client data distributions. In this paper, we propose a label-aware aggregation method FedLA, that addresses the biased models issue by considering the variety of labels in the weighted averaging. It combines two main properties of the client data, namely data size and label distribution. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that FedLA is particularly effective in several heterogeneous data distribution scenarios. Especially when only a small group of the clients is participating in the Federated Learning process. Furthermore, we argue that accurately describing the data distribution is crucial in selecting the appropriate aggregation method. In this regard, we discuss various properties that can be used to describe data distribution and illustrate how these properties can guide the choice of an aggregation method for specific data distributions.}

In this paper, we ask: have Mirai variants evolved to the point that they are fundamentally distinct? We answer this question by measuring two of the most popular Mirai descendants: Hajime and Mozi. To actively scan both botnets simultaneously, we developed a robust measurement infrastructure, BMS, and ran it for more than eight months. The resulting datasets show that these two popular botnets have diverged in their evolutions from their common ancestor in multiple ways: they have virtually no overlapping IP addresses, they exhibit different behavior to network events such as diurnal rate limiting in China, and more. Collectively, our results show that there is no longer one canonical IoT botnet. We discuss the implications of this finding for researchers and practitioners.},

        abstract = {Anonymous microblogging systems are known to be vulnerable to intersection attacks due to network churn. An adversary that monitors all communications can leverage the churn to learn who is publishing what with increasing confidence over time. In this paper, we propose a protocol for mitigating intersection attacks in anonymous microblogging systems by grouping users into anonymity sets based on similarities in their publishing behavior. The protocol provides a configurable communication schedule for users in each set to manage the inevitable trade-off between latency and bandwidth overhead. In our evaluation, we use real-world datasets from two popular microblogging platforms, Twitter and Reddit, to simulate user publishing behavior. The results demonstrate that the protocol can protect users against intersection attacks at low bandwidth overhead when the users adhere to communication schedules. In addition, the protocol can sustain a slow degradation in the size of the anonymity set over time under various churn rates.},

        abstract = {Efficiently optimizing multi-model inference pipelines for fast, accurate, and cost-effective inference is a crucial challenge in ML production systems, given their tight end-to-end latency requirements. To simplify the exploration of the vast and intricate trade-off space of accuracy and cost in inference pipelines, providers frequently opt to consider one of them. However, the challenge lies in reconciling accuracy and cost trade-offs. To address this challenge and propose a solution to efficiently manage model variants in inference pipelines, we present IPA, an online deep-learning Inference Pipeline Adaptation system that efficiently leverages model variants for each deep learning task. Model variants are different versions of pre-trained models for the same deep learning task with variations in resource requirements, latency, and accuracy. IPA dynamically configures batch size, replication, and model variants to optimize accuracy, minimize costs, and meet user-defined latency SLAs using Integer Programming. It supports multi-objective settings for achieving different trade-offs between accuracy and cost objectives while remaining adaptable to varying workloads and dynamic traffic patterns. Extensive experiments on a Kubernetes implementation with five real-world inference pipelines demonstrate that IPA improves normalized accuracy by up to 35\% with a minimal cost increase of less than 5\%.}

        abstract = {The use of machine learning (ML) inference for various applications is growing drastically. ML inference services engage with users directly, requiring fast and accurate responses. Moreover, these services face dynamic workloads of requests, imposing changes in their computing resources. Failing to right-size computing resources results in either latency service level objectives (SLOs) violations or wasted computing resources. Adapting to dynamic workloads considering all the pillars of accuracy, latency, and resource cost is challenging. In response to these challenges, we propose InfAdapter, which proactively selects a set of ML model variants with their resource allocations to meet latency SLO while maximizing an objective function composed of accuracy and cost. InfAdapter decreases SLO violation and costs up to 65 and 33, respectively, compared to a popular industry autoscaler (Kubernetes Vertical Pod Autoscaler).},

Moreover, it is unclear what hardware parts are necessary to design a bicycle simulator and whether a bicycle is needed at all. In this paper, we investigated cycling fidelity and control of VR bicycle simulators. For this, we developed and evaluated three cycling simulators: (1) cycling without a bicycle (bikeless), (2) cycling on a fixed (stationary) and (3) moving bicycle (tandem) with four levels of control (no control, steering, pedaling, and steering + pedaling). To evaluate all combinations of fidelity and control, we conducted a controlled experiment (N = 24) in indoor and outdoor settings. We found that the bikeless setup provides the highest feeling of safety, while the tandem leads to the highest realism without increasing motion sickness. Moreover, we discovered that bicycles are not essential for cycling in VR.},

Deep learning-based state-of- the-art methods for LiDAR MOS strongly depend on anno- tated ground truth data, which is expensive to obtain and scarce in existence. To close this gap in the stationary set- ting, we propose a novel 4D LiDAR representation based on multivariate time series that relaxes the problem of un- supervised MOS to a time series clustering problem. More specifically, we propose modeling the change in occupancy of a voxel by a multivariate occupancy time series (MOTS), which captures spatio-temporal occupancy changes on the voxel level and its surrounding neighborhood. To perform unsupervised MOS, we train a neural network in a self- supervised manner to encode MOTS into voxel-level feature representations, which can be partitioned by a clustering al- gorithm into moving or stationary. Experiments on station- ary scenes from the Raw KITTI dataset show that our fully unsupervised approach achieves performance that is com- parable to that of supervised state-of-the-art approaches.},

The Internet of Things and sensor systems, which enable smart environments and services, are settings where deep learning can provide invaluable utility. However, the data in these systems are very often directly or indirectly related to people, which raises privacy concerns. Federated learning (FL) mitigates some of these concerns and empowers deep learning in sensor-driven environments by enabling multiple entities to collaboratively train a machine learning model without sharing their data. Nevertheless, a number of works in the literature propose attacks that can manipulate the model and disclose information about the training data in FL. As a result, there has been a growing belief that FL is highly vulnerable to severe attacks. Although these attacks do indeed highlight security and privacy risks in FL, some of them may not be as effective in production deployment because they are feasible only given special\&mdash;sometimes impractical\&mdash;assumptions. In this paper, we investigate this issue by conducting a quantitative analysis of the attacks against FL and their evaluation settings in 48 papers. This analysis is the first of its kind to reveal several research gaps with regard to the types and architectures of target models. Additionally, the quantitative analysis allows us to highlight unrealistic assumptions in some attacks related to the hyper-parameters of the model and data distribution. Furthermore, we identify fallacies in the evaluation of attacks which raise questions about the generalizability of the conclusions. As a remedy, we propose a set of recommendations to promote adequate evaluations.},

In a first experiment (N=16), we investigated the effect of these factors on the users' ability to localize stationary sensations. In a second experiment (N=20), we explored the influence of resolution on recognition rate for moving tactile sensations.Findings show that for stationary sensations a 9 actuator display offers a good trade-off and a 3{$\times$}3 resolution can be accurately localized.

The first technique uses two sequential stimuli to communicate the movement vector (Sequential Tactile Vectors). The second technique creates a continuous vibration vector using body-penetrating phantom sensations (Continuous Tactile Vectors). In a user study (N = 16), we compare these two new techniques with state of the art push and pull metaphors. Our findings show that users are 20\% more accurate in their movements with sequential tactile vectors.}

We plan on evaluating the influence of thermal feedback on the 3D sketching experience, with a focus on user creativity in the future.},

        abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) applications are being rapidly deployed in the context of smart homes, automotive vehicles, smart factories, and many more. In these applications, embedded devices are widely used as sensors, actuators, or edge nodes. The embedded devices operate distinctively on a task or interact with each other to collectively perform certain tasks. In general, increase in Internet-connected things has made embedded devices an attractive target for various cyber attacks, where an attacker gains access and control remote devices for malicious activities. These IoT devices could be exploited by an attacker to compromise the security of victim?s platform without requiring any physical hardware access.  In order to detect such software attacks and ensure a reliable and trustworthy IoT application, it is crucial to verify that a device is not compromised by malicious software, and also assert correct execution of the program. In the literature, solutions based on remote attestation, anomaly detection, control-flow and data-flow integrity have been proposed to detect software attacks. However, these solutions have limited applicability in terms of target deployments and attack detection, which we inspect thoroughly.  In this dissertation, we propose three solutions to detect software attacks on embedded IoT devices. In particular, we first propose SWARNA, which uses remote attestation to verify a large network of embedded devices and ensure that the application software on the device is not tampered. Verifying the integrity of a software preserves the static properties of a device. To secure the devices from various software attacks, it is imperative to also ensure that the runtime execution of a program is as expected. Therefore, we focus extensively on detecting memory corruption attacks that may occur during the program execution. Furthermore, we propose, SPADE and OPADE, secure program anomaly detection that runs on embedded IoT devices and use deep learning, and machine learning algorithms respectively to detect various runtime software attacks. We evaluate and analyse all the proposed solutions on real embedded hardware and IoT testbeds. We also perform a thorough security analysis to show how the proposed solutions can detect various software attacks.}

        abstract = {Ambient Intelligence?s vision builds on the integration provided by Ubiquitous Computing and includes the people as the centrepiece and ultimate purpose technology serve. It is based on the increasing technological advances in embedded computational power, information and sensing capabilities embedded into everyday objects. Many projects in the last decade have pursued the realisation of environments sentient to human presence and proactive to support the user?s needs. However, despite the current availability of technology, there is a notorious absence of large-scale settings. This absence raises questions about the complexity and effort required for top-down approaches to make smart environments available everywhere. There are too many scenarios to be modelled one by one in real life, and the scenarios, people, and technology change over time. Several approaches have been pursued to integrate devices and services into federations interacting with humans as a coherent system. However, they need to address devices? cooperation across different environments and include the people as active participants. This results in isolated islands of integration with clearly defined boundaries, such as the smart home or office and between technology and people. This thesis presents a novel paradigm called Open Smart Environments (OSEs) that are based on three main entities: knowledge-bundled devices and services called tangible or soft Smart Products, the Human as a first-class actor with abilities, preferences and skills, and the Environment as a representation of the 3D space where both Human and Smart Products are situated and carry out their daily tasks and activities. Besides the matching architectures and development, these three components require new adaptation mechanisms, component architectures and concepts for their realisation that are also proposed, implemented and demonstrated in this thesis. The proposed components provide the mechanisms to build intelligent environments that gradually grow in complexity and smartness. People and technology interact seamlessly with each other in and across space.},

        abstract = {Peer to Peer (P2P) Netzwerke sind dezentrale Netzwerke, bei denen jeder Teilnehmer gleiche oder zumindest {\"a}hnliche Rollen und Funktionen {\"u}bernehmen.

Knoten k{\"o}nnen im darunterliegenden Netzwerk, dem Underlay, weit voneinander entfernt und nur {\"u}ber mehrere Zwischenschritte verbunden sein. Sind in einem solchen P2P Netzwerk nicht alle Knoten mit jeweils allen anderen Knoten verbunden (full mesh network), so muss das Routing im Overlay stattfinden, damit Nachrichten {\"u}ber potentielle Zwischenknoten weitergeleitet werden und ihr endg{\"u}ltiges Ziel erreichen k{\"o}nnen. Soll das P2P Netzwerk auch noch anonym sein, so stellt das bestimmte Anforderungen an diesen Rou- tingalgorithmus. Zwei neuartige bisher nur simulativ evaluierte Routingalgorithmen f{\"u}r P2P basiertes Publish-Subscribe sollen in dieser Arbeit daher erstmals in einem Forschungsprototypen implementiert und auf ihre Praxistauglichkeit untersucht werden. Das hashkettenbasierte Routing [vgl. 1] und die Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) [vgl. 2] werden dabei dem traditionellen Gossiping und Randomwalk gegen{\"u}bergestellt.

Voice commands, as a popular hands-free alternative, struggle with ambient noise and privacy issues. As an alternative approach, research explored movements of various body parts (e.g., head, arms) as input modalities, with foot-based techniques proving particularly suitable for hands-free interaction. Whereas previous research only considered the movement of the foot as a whole, in this work, we argue that our toes offer further degrees of freedom that can be leveraged for interaction. To explore the viability of toe-based interaction, we contribute the results of a controlled experiment with 18 participants assessing the impact of five factors on the accuracy, efficiency and user experience of such interfaces. Based on the findings, we provide design recommendations for future toe-based interfaces.},

        abstract = {Mid-air gestures, widely used in today?s Augmented Reality (AR) applications, are prone to the ?gorilla arm? effect, leading to discomfort with prolonged interactions. While prior work has proposed metrics to quantify this effect and means to improve comfort and ergonomics, these works usually only consider simplistic, one-dimensional AR interactions, like reaching for a point or pushing a button. However, interacting with AR environments also involves far more complex tasks, such as rotational knobs, potentially impacting ergonomics. This paper advances the understanding of the ergonomics of rotational mid-air interactions in AR. For this, we contribute the results of a controlled experiment exposing the participants to a rotational task in the interaction space defined by their arms? reach. Based on the results, we discuss how novel future mid-air gesture modalities benefit from our findings concerning ergonomic-aware rotational interaction.},

        abstract = {Augmented reality see-through applications rely mostly on machine learning models to detect and localize occluded objects. In this case, the user is usually presented the result with the highest probability without taking into account the uncertainty of the model. However, the uncertainty plays a vital role when considering applications where a critical decision-making process relies heavily on the predictions of the model, such as in the case where occluded cars are shown to a driver. In this work, we conduct an investigation of the effects of communicating the uncertainty of machine learning models to users in AR-based see-through applications. Through a controlled user study, we compare three visualization modes: no visualization, most probable output, and probability distribution. The results of our evaluation reveal that when considering the visualizations, each of them lead to comparable results in terms of speed and accuracy of the decision-making process. A relevant finding is that participants considered uncertainty as a substantial part of the output of machine learning models and needs to be delivered with the results. An additional important conclusion is that the preference of users over a specific visualization is strongly dependent on the particular use case.},

        abstract = {The proximity of Mobile Edge Computing offers the potential for offloading low latency closed-loop applications from mobile devices. However, to repair decreases in quality of service (QoS), e.g., resulting from user mobility, the placement of service instances must be continually updated ? essential for mission critical applications that cannot tolerate decreased QoS, for example virtual reality or networked control systems. This paper presents BigMEC, a decentralized service placement algorithm that achieves scalable, fast, and high-quality placements by making local service migration decisions immediately when a drop in QoS is detected. The algorithm relies on reinforcement learning to adapt to unknown scenarios and to approximate long-term optimal placement updates by taking future transition costs into account. BigMEC limits each decentralized migration decision to nearby edge sites. Thus, decision computation times are independent of the number of nodes in the network and well below 10ms in our experimental setup. Our ablation study validates that, using its scalable approach to decentralized resource conflict resolution, BigMEC quickly approaches optimal placement with increasing local view size, and that it can reliably learn to approximate long-term optimal migration decisions, given only a black-box optimization objective.},

The approach builds on self-supervised learning (SSL) for multivariate time series to distinguish different driving events in the learned latent space. We evaluate our approach with a dataset of real Tesla Model 3 vehicle CAN-data and a two-hour driving session that we annotated with different driving events. With our approach, we evaluate the applicability of recent time series-related contrastive and generative SSL techniques to learn representations that distinguish driving events. Compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative SSL methods for driving event discovery, we find that contrastive learning approaches reach similar performance.},

In this paper, we investigate user perceptions of 2FA through in-depth interviews with 42 participants, revealing key requirements that are not well met today despite recently emerged 2FA solutions. First, we investigate past experiences with authentication mechanisms emphasizing problems and aspects that hamper good user experience. Second, we investigate the different authentication factors more closely. Our results reveal particularly interesting preferences regarding the authentication factor ?ownership? in terms of properties, physical realizations, and interaction. These findings suggest a path towards 2FA mechanisms with considerably better user experience, promising to improve the acceptance and hence, the proliferation of 2FA for the benefit of security in the digital world.},

Our approach is not constrained to particular types of movements, gestures, or activities, thus, allowing users to perform freely and unconstrained their daily routine while the user identification takes place. We evaluate our approach based on IMU data collected from 23 people performing their daily routines unconstrained. Our results indicate that our approach is able to perform activity-free user identification with an accuracy of 0.9485 for 23 users without requiring any direct input or specific action from users.

In this work, we propose four operation modes for ground-based rescue robots to utilize an efficient search and rescue: (a) Handle Mode, (b) Lab Mode, (c) Remote Mode, and (d) UI Mode. We evaluated these operation modes in a controlled lab experiment (N = 8) in terms of robot collisions, number of rescued victims, and mental load. Our results indicate that control modes with robot automation (UI and Remote mode) outperform modes with full control given to participants. In particular, we discovered that UI and Remote Mode lead to the lowest number of collisions, driving time, visible victims remaining, rescued victims, and mental load.},

In a user study (N=18), participants confirmed notifications in Augmented Reality (AR) using the three interaction modalities in a simulated biking scenario. We assessed the efficiency regarding reaction times, error rates, and perceived task load. Our results show significantly faster response times for MAGIC Pointing compared to Dwell Time and Gestures, while Dwell Time led to a significantly lower error rate compared to Gestures.

Since smartphones and AR glasses are the primary devices to present AR information to users, it is essential to understand how the information about a historical site can be presented effectively and what type of device is best suited for information placements. In this paper, we investigate the placement of two types of content, historical images and informational text, for smartphones and AR glasses in the context of outdoor historical sites. For this, we explore three types of placements: (1) on-body, (2) world, and (3) overlay. To evaluate all nine combinations of text and image placements for smartphone and AR glasses, we conducted a controlled experiment (N = 18) at outdoor historical landmarks.

        abstract = {We envision a future where self-driving bicycles can take us to our destinations. This allows cyclists to use their time on the bike efficiently for work or relaxation without having to focus their attention on traffic. In the related field of self-driving cars, research has shown that communicating the planned route to passengers plays an important role in building trust in automation and situational awareness. For self-driving bicycles, this information transfer will be even more important, as riders will need to actively compensate for the movement of a self-driving bicycle to maintain balance. In this paper, we investigate maneuver indications for self-driving bicycles: (1) ambient light in a helmet, (2) head-up display indications, (3) speech feedback, (4) vibration on the handlebar, and (5) no assistance. To evaluate these indications, we conducted an outdoor experiment (N = 25) in a proposed tandem simulator consisting of a tandem bicycle with a steering and braking control on the back seat and a rider in full control of it. Our results indicate that riders respond faster to visual cues and focus comparably on the reading task while riding with and without maneuver indications. Additionally, we found that the tandem simulator is realistic, safe, and creates an awareness of a human cyclist controlling the tandem.}

Some bicycle simulators with tilt functionality have already been presented but still lack a systematic evaluation. In this work, we present a motion-based bicycle simulator without centrifugal force simulation and the results from a user study that compared different tilt modes. N=31 participants completed a study in virtual reality with a strong and a weak tilt mode, as well as a baseline condition without movement. We discovered that weak tilting could significantly improve the cycling realism without decreasing cycling performance and simulator sickness. Furthermore, our research suggests that there is a sweet spot for a tilting function, which facilitates a balance between presence/immersion and simulator sickness.},

        abstract = {How long do vulnerabilities live in the repositories of large, evolving projects? Although the question has been identified as an interesting problem by the software community in online forums, it has not been investigated yet in adequate depth and scale, since the process of identifying the exact point in time when a vulnerability was introduced is particularly cumbersome. In this paper, we provide an automatic approach for accurately estimating how long vulnerabilities remain in the code (their lifetimes). Our method relies on the observation that while it is difficult to pinpoint the exact point of introduction for one vulnerability, it is possible to accurately estimate the average lifetime of a large enough sample of vulnerabilities, via a heuristic approach.  With our approach, we perform the first large-scale measurement of Free and Open Source Software vulnerability lifetimes, going beyond approaches estimating lower bounds prevalent in previous research. We find that the average lifetime of a vulnerability is around 4 years, varying significantly between projects ({\texttt{\char126}}2 years for Chromium, {\texttt{\char126}}7 years for OpenSSL). The distribution of lifetimes can be approximately described by an exponential distribution. There are no statistically significant differences between the lifetimes of different vulnerability types when considering specific projects. Vulnerabilities are getting older, as the average lifetime of fixed vulnerabilities in a given year increases over time, influenced by the overall increase of code age. However, they live less than non-vulnerable code, with an increasing spread over time for some projects, suggesting a notion of maturity that can be considered an indicator of quality. While the introduction of fuzzers does not significantly reduce the lifetimes of memory-related vulnerabilities, further research is needed to better understand and quantify the impact of fuzzers and other tools on vulnerability lifetimes and on the security of codebases.}

Through a user-centric design, we aim to improve the annotation experience and thus reduce its costs. For the preliminary evaluation of our environment, we conduct a user study (N=20) to quantify the effect of higher levels of immersion in combination with the visual aids we implemented on the annotation process. Our findings reveal that higher levels of immersion combined with object-based visual aids lead to a faster and more engaging annotation process.}

        abstract = {Deep learning (DL) inference has become an essential building block in modern intelligent applications. Due to the high computational intensity of DL, it is critical to scale DL inference serving systems in response to fluctuating workloads to achieve resource efficiency. Meanwhile, intelligent applications often require strict service level agreements (SLAs), which need to be guaranteed when the system is scaled. The problem is complex and has been tackled only in simple scenarios so far.This paper describes FA2, a fast and accurate autoscaler concept for DL inference serving systems. In contrast to related works, FA2 adopts a general, contrived two-phase approach. Specifically, it starts by capturing the autoscaling challenges in a comprehensive graph-based model. Then, FA2 applies targeted graph transformation and makes autoscaling decisions with an efficient algorithm based on dynamic programming. We implemented FA2 and built and evaluated a prototype. Compared with state-of-the-art autoscaling solutions, our experiments showed FA2 to achieve significant resource reduction (19\% under CPUs and 25\% under GPUs, on average) in combination with low SLA violations (less than 1.5\%). FA2 performed close to the theoretical optimum, matching exactly the optimal decisions (with the least required resources) in 96.8\% of all the cases in our evaluation.}

        abstract = {Edge computing is a promising solution for reducing service latency by provisioning time-sensitive services directly from the network edge. However, upon workload peaks at the resource-limited edge, an edge service has to queue service requests, incurring high waiting time. Such quality of service (QoS) degradation ruins the reputation and reduces the long-term revenue of the service provider.To address this issue, we propose an admission control mechanism for time-sensitive edge services. Specifically, we allow the service provider to offer admission advice to arriving requests regarding whether to join for service or balk to seek alternatives. Our goal is twofold: maximizing revenue of the service provider and ensuring QoS if the provided admission advice is followed. To this end, we propose a threshold structure that estimates the highest length of the request queue. Leveraging such a threshold structure, we propose O2A, a mechanism to balance the trade-off between increasing revenue from accepting more requests and guaranteeing QoS by advising requests to balk. Rigorous analysis shows that O2A achieves the goal and that the provided admission advice is optimal for end-users to follow. We further validate O2A through trace-driven simulations with both synthetic and real-world service request traces.},

        abstract = {Serverless edge computing adopts an event-based model where Internet-of-Things (IoT) services are executed in lightweight containers only when requested, leading to significantly improved edge resource utilization. Unfortunately, the startup latency of containers degrades the responsiveness of IoT services dramatically. Container caching, while masking this latency, requires retaining resources thus compromising resource efficiency. In this paper, we study the retention-aware container caching problem in serverless edge computing. We leverage the distributed and heterogeneous nature of edge platforms and propose to optimize container caching jointly with request distribution. We reveal step by step that this joint optimization problem can be mapped to the classic ski-rental problem. We first present an online competitive algorithm for a special case where request distribution and container caching are based on a set of carefully designed probability distribution functions. Based on this algorithm, we propose an online algorithm called O-RDC for the general case, which incorporates the resource capacity and network latency by opportunistically distributing requests. We conduct extensive experiments to examine the performance of the proposed algorithms with both synthetic and real-world serverless computing traces. Our results show that ORDC outperforms existing caching strategies of current serverless computing platforms by up to 94.5\% in terms of the overall system cost.}

        abstract = {The recent trend towards more programmable switching hardware in data centers opens up new possibilities for distributed applications to leverage in-network computing (INC). Literature so far has largely focused on individual application scenarios of INC, leaving aside the problem of coordinating usage of potentially scarce and heterogeneous switch resources among multiple INC scenarios, applications, and users. Alas, the traditional model of resource pools of isolated compute containers does not fit an INC-enabled data center. This paper describes HIRE, a holistic INC-aware resource manager which allows for server-local and INC resources to be coordinated in unison. HIRE introduces a novel flexible resource (meta-)model to address heterogeneity and resource interchangeability, and includes two approaches for INC scheduling: (a) retrofitting existing schedulers; (b) designing a new one. For (a), HIRE presents a retrofitting API and demonstrates it with four state-of-the-art schedulers. For (b), HIRE proposes a flow-based scheduler, cast as a min-cost max-flow problem, where a unified cost model is used to integrate the different costs. Experiments with a workload trace of a 4000 machine cluster show that HIRE makes better use of INC resources by serving 8-30\% more INC requests, while simultaneously reducing network detours by 20\% and reducing tail placement latency by 50\%.}

In this paper, we propose six 3D teleportation methods in virtual environments based on the combination of two existing aiming methods (linear and parabolic) and three types of transitioning to a target (instant, interpolated and continuous). To investigate the performance of the proposed teleportation methods, we conducted a controlled lab experiment (N = 24) with a mid-air coin collection task to assess accuracy, efciency and VR sickness. We discovered that the linear aiming method leads to faster and more accurate target selection. Moreover, a combination of linear aiming and instant transitioning leads to the highest efciency and accuracy without increasing VR sickness.}

We conducted an outdoor experiment (N = 13) using an Augmented Reality simulation and compared these types of warnings in terms of reaction time, accident rate, and feeling of safety. Our results indicate that AR and auditory warnings lead to shorter reaction times, have a better perception, and create a better feeling of safety than vibrotactile warnings. Moreover, auditory signals have a higher acceptance by the riders compared to the other two types of warnings.},

        abstract = {Cycling has become increasingly popular as a means of transportation. However, cyclists remain a highly vulnerable group of road users. According to accident reports, one of the most dangerous situations for cyclists are uncontrolled intersections, where cars approach from both directions. To address this issue and assist cyclists in crossing decision-making at uncontrolled intersections, we designed two visualizations that: (1) highlight occluded cars through an X-ray vision and (2) depict the remaining time the intersection is safe to cross via a Countdown. To investigate the efficiency of these visualizations, we proposed an Augmented Reality simulation as a novel evaluation method, in which the above visualizations are represented as AR, and conducted a controlled experiment with 24 participants indoors. We found that the X-ray ensures a fast selection of shorter gaps between cars, while the Countdown facilitates a feeling of safety and provides a better intersection overview.},

However, current solutions still create mismatches between the visuals and physical movement, which causes VR sickness and diminishes the cycling experience. To reduce VR sickness in bicycle simulators, we conducted two controlled lab experiments addressing two main causes of VR sickness: (1) steering methods and (2) cycling trajectory. In the frst experiment (N = 18) we compared handlebar, HMD, and upper-body steering methods. In the second experiment (N = 24) we explored three types of movement in VR (1D, 2D, and 3D trajectories) and three countermeasures (airfow, vibration, and dynamic Field-of-View) to reduce VR sickness. We found that handlebar steering leads to the lowest VR sickness without decreasing cycling performance and airfow suggests to be the most promising method to reduce VR sickness for all three types of trajectories.},

Our concept is based on conveying the semantics of the scene uniquely, without revealing the identity of the individuals or the contextual details that might violate the privacy of the entities present in the surveillance area. For this, we create a virtual replica of the areas of interest, in real-time, through the combination of procedurally generated environments and markerless motion capture models. The results of our preliminary evaluation revealed that our system successfully conceals privacy-sensitive data, while preserving the semantics of the scene. Furthermore, participants in our user study expressed higher acceptance to being surveilled through the proposed system.},

To provide a wide range of matching sensations of being touched or stroked, current approaches typically need large numbers of different physical textures. However, even advanced devices can only accommodate a limited number of textures to remain wearable. Therefore, a better understanding is necessary of how expectations elicited by different visualizations affect haptic perception, to achieve a balance between physical constraints and great variety of matching physical textures. In this work, we conducted an experiment (N=31) assessing how the perception of roughness is affected within VR. We designed a prototype for arm stroking and compared the effects of different visualizations on the perception of physical textures with distinct roughnesses. Additionally, we used the visualizations' real-world materials, no-haptics and vibrotactile feedback as baselines. As one result, we found that two levels of roughness can be sufficient to convey a realistic illusion.},

        abstract = {Global malware campaigns and large-scale data breaches show how everyday life can be impacted when the defensive measures fail to protect computer systems from cyber threats. Understanding the threat landscape and the adversaries' attack tactics to perform it represent key factors for enabling an efficient defense against threats over the time. Of particular importance is the acquisition of timely and accurate information from threats intelligence sources available on the web which can provide additional intelligence on emerging threats even before they can be observed as actual attacks. Currently, specific indicators of compromise (e.g. IP addresses, domains, hashsums of malicious files) are shared in a semi-automated and structured way via so-called threat feeds. Unfortunately, current systems have to deal with the trade-off between the timeliness of such an alert (i.e. warning at the first mention of a threat) and the need to wait for verification by other sources (i.e. warning after multiple sources have verified the threat). In addition, due to the increasing number of open sources, it is challenging to find the right balance between feasibility and costs in order to identify a relatively small subset of valuable sources. In this paper, a method to automate the assessment of cyber threat intelligence sources and predict a relevance score for each source is proposed. Specifically, a model based on meta-data and word embedding is defined and experimented by training regression models to predict the relevance score of sources on Twitter. The results evaluation show that the assigned score allows to reduce the waiting time for intelligence verification, on the basis of its relevance, thus improving the time advantage of early threat detection.},

Such means would make security an observable attribute, helping users make informed choices and allowing vendors to ?charge? for it{--}thus, providing strong incentives for more security investment. This dissertation presents three empirical measurement studies introducing new approaches to measuring aspects of software security, focusing on Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS).  First, to revisit the fundamental question of whether software is maturing over time, we study the vulnerability rate of packages in stable releases of the Debian GNU/Linux software distribution. Measuring the vulnerability rate through the lens of Debian stable: (a) provides a natural time frame to test for maturing behavior, (b) reduces noise and bias in the data (only CVEs with a Debian Security Advisory), and (c) provides a best-case assessment of maturity (as the Debian release cycle is rather conservative). Overall, our results do not support the hypothesis that software in Debian is maturing over time, suggesting that vulnerability finding-and-fixing does not scale and more effort should be invested in significantly reducing the introduction rate of vulnerabilities, e.g. via ?security by design? approaches like memory-safe programming languages.  Second, to gain insights beyond the number of reported vulnerabilities, we study how long vulnerabilities remain in the code of popular FLOSS projects (i.e. their lifetimes). We provide the first, to the best of our knowledge, method for automatically estimating the mean lifetime of a set of vulnerabilities based on information in vulnerability-fixing commits. Using this method, we study the lifetimes of {\texttt{\char126}}6 000 CVEs in 11 popular FLOSS projects. Among a number of findings, we identify two quantities of particular interest for software security metrics: (a) the spread between mean vulnerability lifetime and mean code age at the time of fix, and (b) the rate of change of the aforementioned spread.  Third, to gain insights into the important human aspect of the vulnerability finding process, we study the characteristics of vulnerability reporters for 4 popular FLOSS projects. We provide the first, to the best of our knowledge, method to create a large dataset of vulnerability reporters ({\ensuremath{>}}2 000 reporters for {\ensuremath{>}}4 500 CVEs) by combining information from a number of publicly available online sources. We proceed to analyze the dataset and identify a number of quantities that, suitably combined, can provide indications regarding the health of a project?s vulnerability finding ecosystem.  Overall, we showed that measurement studies carefully designed to target crucial aspects of the software security ecosystem can provide valuable insights and indications regarding the ?quality of security? of software. However, the road to good security metrics is still long. New approaches covering other important aspects of the process are needed, while the approaches introduced in this dissertation should be further developed and improved.}

However, the design of SSVEP-eliciting stimuli often does not match the virtual environment, and thus, disrupts the virtual experience. In this paper, we investigate stimulus designs with varying suitability to blend in virtual environments. Therefore, we created differently-shaped, virtual butterflies. The shapes vary from rectangular wings, over round wings, to a wing shape of a real butterfly. These butterflies elicit SSVEP responses through different animations ? flickering or flapping wings. To evaluate our stimuli, we first extracted suitable frequencies for SSVEP responses from the literature. In a first study, we determined three frequencies yielding the best detection accuracy in VR. We used these frequencies in a second study to analyze detection accuracy and appearance ratings using our stimuli designs. Our work contributes insights into the design of SSVEP stimuli that blend into virtual environments and still elicit SSVEP responses.},

Zentrales Artefakt dieser Zusammenarbeit ist eine gro{\ss}e Papierkarte, deren digitales Gegenst{\"u}ck auf dem Bildschirmtisch den etablierten Praktiken zur Abbildung der Situation auf dieser Karte Rechnung tragen muss (Bedienung).  Im Rahmen des Entwurfs zeigen sich dabei eine Reihe von Interaktionsproblemen, f{\"u}r die neue, leichtgewichtige L{\"o}sungen entwickelt werden, die ohne Modifikation der Hardware, d. h. auch mit kommerziell verf{\"u}gbaren Bildschirmtischen, zum Einsatz kommen k{\"o}nnen. Dabei handelt es sich u. a. um Techniken zum Einsatz digitaler Anoto-Stifte auf Bildschirmtischen mit optischer Sensorik, zur Benutzererkennung von einzelnen Interaktionen ? sowohl f{\"u}r Ber{\"u}hrungssteuerung als auch Bedienung mit einem digitalen Stift ? und um ein System zur dynamischen Sitzungs- und Zugriffskontrolle.  Die Arbeit schlie{\ss}t mit einer umfassenden Benutzerstudie, in welcher 30 Teilnehmer in einem fiktiven Krisenszenario Aufgaben bearbeiten, die entsprechende Arbeitsschritte echter Krisenst{\"a}be des Katastrophenschutzes bei der Behandlung einer solchen Situation widerspiegeln. Verglichen werden dabei die neu entwickelte Software f{\"u}r interaktive Bildschirmtische, ein handels{\"u}bliches Geoinformationssystem f{\"u}r Desktop-Computer, und klassische Papierkarten. Die Auswertung zeigt, dass mit der neu entwickelten Software und den in sie integrierten Interaktionstechniken die h{\"o}chste Effizienz und die beste Benutzererfahrung erreicht werden; die Software bietet zudem eine ebenso hohe Teamarbeitsqualit{\"a}t wie die klassischen Papierkarten.  Diese Ergebnisse zeigen, dass der im Rahmen dieser Arbeit entwickelte Entwurfsprozess in der Lage ist, die Entwicklung von Software f{\"u}r interaktive Bildschirmtische so zu steuern, dass diese eine gemeinsame Bearbeitung von Aufgaben auch in komplexen Anwendungsbereichen effizient unterst{\"u}tzt.}

        abstract = {Movement guidance in virtual reality has many applications ranging from physical therapy, assistive systems to sport learning. These movements range from simple single-limb to complex multi-limb movements. While VR supports many perspectives ? e.g., first person and third person ? it remains unclear how accurate these perspectives communicate different movements. In a user study (N=18), we investigated the influence of perspective, feedback, and movement properties on the accuracy of movement guidance. Participants had on average an angle error of 6.2? for single arm movements, 7.4? for synchronous two arm movements, and 10.3? for synchronous two arm and leg movements. Furthermore, the results show that the two variants of third-person perspectives outperform a first-person perspective for movement guidance (19.9\% and 24.3\% reduction in angle errors). Qualitative feedback confirms the quantitative data and shows users have a clear preference for third-person perspectives. Through our findings we provide guidance for designers and developers of future VR movement guidance systems.},

        abstract = {Intersection attacks, which are popular traffic analysis attacks, have been extensively studied in anonymous point-to-point communication scenarios. These attacks are also known to be challenging threats to anonymous group communication, e.g., microblogging. However, it remains unclear how powerful these attacks can be, especially when considering realistic user communication behavior. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of intersection attacks on anonymous microblogging systems utilizing Twitter and Reddit datasets. Our findings show that the attacks are effective regardless of whether users post their messages under pseudonyms or publish them to topics without attaching identifiers. Additionally, we observed that attacks are feasible under certain settings despite increasing userbase size, communication rounds' length, cover traffic, or traffic delays.},

        abstract = {Haptics are an important factor to make virtual worlds and remote interpersonal interaction tangible. While current technological advances, such as Virtual Reality (VR), are reaching the mass market, they are primarily visual while available haptic devices are mostly limited to vibrotactile stimuli, such as smartphone notifications or embedded in game controllers. However, haptic feedback consists of more components that make an experience physically perceivable and lifelike. In addition to the vibrotactile stimulation of fine mechanoreception, these also incorporate stronger forces addressing pressure-based mechanoreception, temperature perceived by thermoception, and body position and movement perceived by proprioception, which are all parts of the somatosensory system. Consequently, to get closer to a full haptic experience, haptics need to be considered in the broader context of the complete somatosensory system.  In this thesis, novel haptic concepts will be introduced and implemented in prototypical systems to investigate them in a series of user studies, leading to a better understanding of somatosensory interaction. In this context, this dissertation provides six major contributions: (1) The first contribution presents a systematic investigation of fine and subtle mechanoreception involving vibrotactile stimuli on the hand for guidance and target acquisition. (2) The second contribution investigates more intense and pressure-based mechanoreception that employs pneumatically actuated air cushions to create immediate pressure sensations. (3) The third contribution on mechanoreception combines the findings of the previous two contributions and explores moving touches and stroke stimuli on the body, as well as their roughness perception in VR. (4) The fourth contribution addresses thermoception where the effects of cold and warm temperatures on the body are investigated within a VR environment. (5) The fifth contribution focuses on proprioception and kinesthesia and examines concepts for kinesthetic actuations that can evoke flexion and extension of body joints. (6) In a further contribution, a novel rapid prototyping platform is presented that considers the specific requirements for haptic actuations of the somatosensory system.},

For this, we first determined the features of network flows and packets alike, which are relevant to this task. We then created a dataset by extracting the relevant features from well-known network traffic datasets from the field of network intrusion detection (NID), as well as falsifying said datapoints to provide negative samples. We also provide a pipeline for the process of creating such datasets.  For our NN model we compared available architectures of recurrent neural networks (RNNs): simple RNN (simpleRNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). Furthermore our model uses a special kind of RNN called a conditional RNN (condRNN), which already has provided good results for a mixture of conditional and sequential input in the field of image region classification. This is necessary as a flow is the conditional counterpart to a sequence of packets. We aim to test the effectiveness of the different RNN architectures in regards to our problem and in the context of condRNNs.}

To date, the best performing approaches in this task are based on deep learning models. Although the performance of the approaches has been increasingly improving, a number of issues still remain. Specifically, in this paper we focus on the issue of the dependence of today\&rsquo;s state-of-the-art approaches to complex ad hoc deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), or a combination of both, which require specialized knowledge and considerable effort for their construction and optimal tuning. To address this issue, in this paper we propose an approach that automatically transforms the inertial sensors time-series data into images that represent in pixel form patterns found over time, allowing even a simple CNN to outperform complex ad hoc deep learning models that combine RNNs and CNNs for activity recognition. We conducted an extensive evaluation considering seven benchmark datasets that are among the most relevant in activity recognition. Our results demonstrate that our approach is able to outperform the state of the art in all cases, based on image representations that are generated through a process that is easy to implement, modify, and extend further, without the need of developing complex deep learning models.}

        abstract = {More than half of the world's population benefits from online social network (OSN) services. A considerable part of these services is mainly based on applying analytics on user data to infer their preferences and enrich their experience accordingly. At the same time, user data is monetized by service providers to run their business models. Therefore, providers tend to extensively collect (personal) data about users. However, this data is oftentimes used for various purposes without informed consent of the users. Providers share this data in different forms with third parties (e.g., data brokers). Moreover, user sensitive data was repeatedly a subject of unauthorized access by malicious parties. These issues have demonstrated the insufficient commitment of providers to user privacy, and consequently, raised users' concerns. Despite the emergence of privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR and CCPA), recent studies showed that user personal data collection and sharing sensitive data are still continuously increasing.  A number of privacy-friendly OSNs have been proposed to enhance user privacy by reducing the need for central service providers. However, this improvement in privacy protection usually comes at the cost of losing social connectivity and many analytics-based services of the wide-spread OSNs. This dissertation addresses this issue by first proposing an approach to privacy-friendly OSNs that maintains established social connections. Second, approaches that allow users to collaboratively apply distributed analytics while preserving their privacy are presented. Finally, the dissertation contributes to better assessment and mitigation of the risks associated with distributed analytics. These three research directions are treated through the following six contributions.   Conceptualizing Hybrid Online Social Networks: We conceptualize a hybrid approach to privacy-friendly OSNs, HOSN. This approach combines the benefits of using COSNs and DOSN. Users can maintain their social experience in their preferred COSN while being provided with additional means to enhance their privacy. Users can seamlessly post public content or private content that is accessible only by authorized users (friends) beyond the reach of the service providers.      Improving the Trustworthiness of HOSNs: We conceptualize software features to address users' privacy concerns in OSNs. We prototype these features in our HOSN\}approach and evaluate their impact on the privacy concerns and the trustworthiness of the approach. Also, we analyze the relationships between four important aspects that influence users' behavior in OSNs: privacy concerns, trust beliefs, risk beliefs, and the willingness to use.      Privacy-Enhanced Association Rule Mining: We present an approach to enable users to apply efficiently privacy-enhanced association rule mining on distributed data. This approach can be employed in DOSN and HOSN to generate recommendations. We leverage a privacy-enhanced distributed graph sampling method to reduce the data required for the mining and lower the communication and computational overhead. Then, we apply a distributed frequent itemset mining algorithm in a privacy-friendly manner.      Privacy Enhancements on Federated Learning (FL): We identify several privacy-related issues in the emerging distributed machine learning technique, FL. These issues are mainly due to the centralized nature of this technique. We discuss tackling these issues by applying FL in a hierarchical architecture. The benefits of this approach include a reduction in the centralization of control and the ability to place defense and verification methods more flexibly and efficiently within the hierarchy.      Systematic Analysis of Threats in Federated Learning: We conduct a critical study of the existing attacks in FL to better understand the actual risk of these attacks under real-world scenarios. First, we structure the literature in this field and show the research foci and gaps. Then, we highlight a number of issues in (1) the assumptions commonly made by researchers and (2) the evaluation practices. Finally, we discuss the implications of these issues on the applicability of the proposed attacks and recommend several remedies.      Label Leakage from Gradients: We identify a risk of information leakage when sharing gradients in FL. We demonstrate the severity of this risk by proposing a novel attack that extracts the user annotations that describe the data (i.e., ground-truth labels) from gradients. We show the high effectiveness of the attack under different settings such as different datasets and model architectures. We also test several defense mechanisms to mitigate this attack and conclude the effective ones.}

        abstract = {As a result of the ongoing digitization, people are increasingly interacting with digital data. Since these data can contain sensitive personal information, the privacy of users plays a central role in the digitization. However, current technologies often do not reflect the capabilities and knowledge of their users sufficiently or do not offer options for individual privacy protection. As a result, users can be overwhelmed when trying to enforce personal privacy preferences or can have difficulties making privacy decisions. Consequently, the privacy-sovereignty of users in the digital world is limited. This thesis investigates mechanisms and principles that enable users to interact sovereignly in the digital world in the scope of information privacy. The three main contributions of this thesis are as follows:  The first main contribution explores privacy protection through two-factor authentication. First, user experiences and preferences are captured in an interview study. Based on the results, requirements for usable and customizable two-factor authentication are described. A concept for two-factor authentication utilizing individualizable 3D-printed objects is developed, implemented, and evaluated to realize these requirements.  The second main contribution explores individual verifiability of private data in the context of Internet voting. First, a categorization of existing cryptographic schemes that particularly considers voters is developed. Then, the categories of schemes are evaluated in a user study. Interface realizations of the category that performed best in this investigation are evaluated in more depth and refined in three consecutive studies.   The third main contribution deals with the data of people in environments that are equipped with IoT devices. First, individual perceptions and mental models of privacy in these environments are examined. Based on this, a concept for personal privacy assistance based on privacy profiles is presented and investigated in a large scale study.

        abstract = {Online Social Networks (OSNs), together with messaging services are tools for the exchange of entertainment-related information. However, they represent virtual environments capable of providing relevant information related to emergency or criminal events. Thanks to the simple way of using OSNs in combination to modern ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT) smart devices, the generation and exploitation of such information is made available to users in real-time even more easily. Unfortunately, its reuse has not been taken into consideration yet due to the lack of specific models and related software tools. In this context, the paper presents a social media-based over layer for supporting the monitoring, detection, computation and information sharing of social media information related to emergency scenarios centered on smartphones and text mining techniques. The proposal is assessed through two different case studies, by evaluating the performances of different classifiers and by showing the logic of the functionalities of the related apps.}

Alongside them, unpleasant unforeseen situations can take place such as being robbed on the street or even being taken hostage. Providing information related to the crime scene or requesting help from the competent authorities is difficult. That is why, mechanisms to support users in such situations, based on their physical status, would be of great importance. Based on such idea, a context-aware model for detecting specific situations of danger is proposed. It is characterized by a set of defined features related to the body posture, the stress level and geolocation whose values are gathered through a smartphone and a smartwatch, as enabling technologies for the local computation. A machine learning technique was adopted for supporting body posture recognition, whereas a threshold-based approach was used to detect the stress level and to evaluate of user{\^a}??s location. After the description of the proposed model, the achieved results as well as current limits are also discussed.},

The content that participants of these systems publish and subscribe to is typically public, but they may nevertheless wish to remain anonymous. While many existing systems allow users to omit explicit identifiers, they do not address the obvious privacy risks of being associated with content that may contain a wide range of sensitive information. We present 2PPS (Twice-Private Publish-Subscribe), the first pub/sub protocol to deliver strong provable privacy protection for both publishers and subscribers, leveraging Distributed Point Function-based secret sharing for publishing and Private Information Retrieval for subscribing. 2PPS does not require trust in other clients and its privacy guarantees hold as long as even a single honest server participant remains. Furthermore, it is scalable and delivers latency suitable for microblogging applications. A prototype implementation of 2PPS can handle 100,000 concurrent active clients with 5 seconds end-to-end latency and significantly lower bandwidth requirements than comparable systems.},

In this paper, we analyze the challenges in achieving SLO for edge video analytics and present a system design for timely edge video analytics over the air leveraging a simple yet effective idea---feedback control.

        abstract = {The insider threat is often cited as one of the most challenging threats for security practitioners. Even though this topic is receiving considerable attention, two main problems remain unsolved. First, research on insider threats is focusing on many different insiders without being able to actually identify and consistently entitle the key aspects of the insiders. As a result, this research can neither be identified by practitioners as being relevant for their real-world insider problems, nor can it be compared with other research targeting the same insider aspects. Second, a clear understanding of insiders is vital for analysing, which insider properties are responsible for the peculiarity of insider threats. In this article, a systematic approach to dissect the defining aspects of insiders is proposed, which includes specific allocatable insider characteristics. Additionally, the insider characteristics are extended toward insider types, which establish universal and unambiguous names for different insiders and which are related with each other to form a new and simple insider taxonomy. The new foundations on insiders allow the comparison of different insider research in a structured manner. Furthermore, the new approach facilitates the identification of specific features of insider threats in future work.}

However, the CnC IP addresses are still exposed in plain-text in publicly available DNS A records, which can be exploited by defenders to disrupt botnet operations. This paper presents the concept of the IP Generation Algorithm (IGA) as a novel method, usable by botmasters, to encrypt the CnC IP address in DNS records to avoid plain-text IP address exposure. This raises the bar for blacklisting malicious IP addresses, and can also be combined with existing techniques to further harden the CnC. For use by defenders, an IGA botnet detection method based on the combination of DNS and NetFlow data is presented and validated using an emulated botnet and an ISP data set.}

One strategy for mitigating hazardous situations and improving the overall resilience of the system is to involve citizens. For instance, smart grids involve prosumers{--}capable of producing and consuming electricity{--}who can adjust their electricity profile dynamically (i.âe., decrease or increase electricity consumption), or use their local production to supply electricity to the grid. This mitigates the impact of peak consumption periods on the grid and makes it easier for operators to control the grid. This involvement of prosumers is accompanied by numerous socio-technical challenges, including motivating citizens to contribute by adjusting their electricity consumption to the requirements of the energy grid. Towards this end, this work investigates motivational strategies and tools, including nudging, persuasive technologies, and incentives, that can be leveraged to increase the motivation of citizens. We discuss long-term and side effects and ethical and privacy considerations, before portraying bug bounty programs, gamification and apps as technologies and strategies to communicate the motivational strategies to citizens.},

To this end, analysts configure discovery pipelines in which logs are filtered, enriched, abstracted, and process models are derived. While pipeline operations are necessary to manage log imperfections and complexity, they might, however, influence the nature of the discovered process model and its properties. Ultimately, not considering this possibility can negatively affect downstream decision making. We hence propose a framework for assessing the consistency of model properties with respect to the pipeline operations and their parameters, and, if inconsistencies are present, for revealing which parameters contribute to them. Following recent literature on software engineering for machine learning, we refer to it as debugging. From evaluating our framework in a real-world analysis scenario based on complex event logs and third-party pipeline configurations, we see strong evidence towards it being a valuable addition to the process mining toolbox.},

        abstract = {The increasing complexity of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) makes their design, development and operation extremely challenging. Due to the nature of CPS that involves many heterogeneous components, which are often designed and developed by organizations belonging to different engineering domains, it is difficult to manage, trace and verify their properties, requirements and constraints throughout their lifecycle by using classical techniques. In this context, the paper presents an integrated solution to formally define system requirements and automate their verification through simulation. The solution is based on the FOrmal Requirements Modeling Language and the Modelica language. The solution is exemplified through two case studies concerning a Trailing-Edge High-Lift system and a Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning system.}

        abstract = {The transformation of energy grids towards smart grids is driven by numerous political, economic, and ecological goals. As part of this process, the centralized top-down architecture of energy grids changes towards increasingly decentralized structures. It is widely accepted that the challenges emerging from this transition threaten the resilient operation of energy grids. For instance, the volatility of renewable energy sources challenges the required balance between demand and supply; their distribution in the energy grid likewise complicates their coordination. Holarchies are a promising (systems-of-systems) architectural pattern for smart grids fostering fast isolation and self-sustained operation of subparts (so-called holons), as well as supporting dynamic reconfigurations of the grid?s structure. To leverage these properties to increase the resilience of smart grids, we propose a system model that combines a holonic architecture and locally available resources offered by prosumers. Our model organizes the participants in the grid as holarchy and enables the application of fine-grained control mechanisms. We show the capabilities of the model by resolving an overproduction situation and a situation of severe electricity scarcity using a modified binary ant colony optimization approach. Our evaluation with the simulation environment HOLEG shows that the system model and the proposed algorithm can quickly mitigate balancing problems in holonic energy grids.},

        abstract = {The transition of energy grids toward future smart grids is challenging in every way: politically, economically, legally, and technically. While many aspects progress at a velocity unthinkable a generation ago, one aspect remained mostly dormant: human electricity consumers. The involvement of consumers thus far can be summarized by two questions: ?Should I buy the eco-friendly appliance? Will solar pay off for me?? However, social and psychological aspects of consumers can profoundly contribute to resilient smart grids. This vision paper explores the role of active consumer-producers (prosumers) in the resilient operation of smart energy grids. We investigate how data can empower people to become more involved in energy grid operations, the potential of heightened awareness, mechanisms for incentives, and other tools for enhancing prosumer actions toward resilience. We further explore the potential benefits to people and system when people are active, aware participants in the goals and operation of the system.},

However, prototyping of actuated devices nowadays often requires repetitive and time-consuming steps, such as wiring, soldering, and programming basic communication, before HCI researchers and designers can focus on their primary interest: designing interaction. In this paper, we present ActuBoard, a prototyping platform to support 1) quick assembly, 2) less preparation work, and 3) the inclusion of non-tech-savvy users. With ActuBoard, users are not required to create complex circuitry, write a single line of firmware, or implementing communication protocols. Acknowledging existing systems, our platform combines the flexibility of low-level microcontrollers and ease-of-use of abstracted tinker platforms to control actuators from separate applications. As further contribution, we highlight the technical specifications and published the ActuBoard platform as Open Source.}

At present, the influence of display types and visualizations have not been investigated in the literature. These factors are important as they directly impact perception and cognitive load, and hence influence the performance of participants. In this paper, we conducted a controlled experiment with 20 participants to compare the use of five display types with different screen sizes: smartphones, tablets, desktop monitors, TVs, and large displays. On each device, we compared three common visualizations for posture guidance: skeletons, silhouettes, and 3d body models. To conduct our assessment, we developed a mobile and cross-platform system that only requires a single camera. Our results show that compared to a smartphone display, larger displays show a lower error. Regarding the choice of visualization, participants rated 3D body models as significantly more usable in comparison to a skeleton visualization.}

        abstract = {The increasing rate of polarization and radicalization has been a growing concern across Europe, both on-the-ground and more recently in the online sphere. Within Central and Eastern Europe in particular, first-line practitioners (FLPs) face an additional set of challenges, including working in a region with an unstable democracy, significant minority groups who continue to be oppressed, including Roma and Travelers, or a surge in right-wing populist parties. In recent years, ideological groups including right- wing, anti-Semitic, and xenophobic groups have taken full advantage of the internet and social media, broadening their reach and their impact as never before. FLPs are often alone, receive little support, and do not have established networks to be able to seek advice from. Indeed, there is a wealth of information available online, but scattered across different websites and requires significant time and effort to sift through. It is clear that working toward prevention requires not only (i) a multi-faceted approach, not only taking traditional securitized P/CVE (Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism) tactics but specifically developing innovative strategies that address the specific issues of the region as well as joint, cross-institutional action by all stakeholders involved. This paper presents a newly- developed online platform developed specifically for FLPs, based on their needs. It is divided into three specific sections which work in an independent but complementary manner, and together provide FLPs with different tools as well as a collaboration platform to support them in their day to day work.}

        abstract = {Common deployment models for Edge Computing are based on (composable) microservices that are offloaded to cloudlets. Runtime adaptations-in response to varying load, QoS fulfillment, mobility, etc.-are typically based on coarse-grained and costly management operations such as resource re-allocation or migration. The services themselves, however, remain non-adaptive, worsening the already limited elasticity of Edge Computing compared to Cloud Computing. Edge computing applications often have stringent requirements on the execution time but are flexible regarding the quality of a computation. The potential benefits of exploiting this trade-off remain untapped. This paper introduces the concept of adaptable microservices that provide alternative variants of specific functionalities. We define so-called service variants that differ w.r.t. the internal functioning of the service, manifested in different algorithms, parameters, and auxiliary data they use. Such variants allow fine-grained trade-offs between the QoS (e.g., a maximum tolerable execution time) and the quality of the computation. We integrate adaptable microservices into an Edge Computing framework, show the practical impact of service variants, and present a strategy for switching variants at runtime.}

        abstract = {Internet-based communication systems have become an increasing tool for spreading misinformation and propaganda. Even though there exist mechanisms that are able to track unwarranted information and messages, users made up different ways to avoid their scrutiny and detection. An example is represented by the mixed-code language, that is text written in an unconventional form by combining different languages, symbols, scripts and shapes. It aims to make more difficult the detection of specific content, due to its custom and ever changing appearance, by using special characters to substitute for alphabet letters. Indeed, such substitute combinations of symbols, which tries to resemble the shape of the intended alphabet?s letter, makes it still intuitively readable to humans, however nonsensical to machines. In this context, the paper explores the possibility of identifying propaganda in such mixed-code texts over the Internet, centred on a machine learning based approach. In particular, an algorithm in combination with a deep learning models for character identification is proposed in order to detect and analyse whether an element contains propaganda related content. The overall approach is presented, the results gathered from its experimentation are discussed and the achieved performances are compared with the related works.}

        abstract = {Edge computing is emerging as a promising computing paradigm for supporting next-generation applications that rely on low-latency network connections in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) era. Many edge applications, such as multi-player augmented reality (AR) gaming and federated machine learning, require that distributed clients work collaboratively for a common goal through message exchanges. Given an edge network, it is an open problem how to deploy such collaborative edge applications to achieve the best overall system performance. This paper presents a formal study of this problem. We first provide a mix of cost models to capture the system. Based on a thorough formulation, we propose an iterative algorithm dubbed ITEM, where in each iteration, we construct a graph to encode all the costs and convert the cost optimization problem into a graph cut problem. By obtaining the minimum s-t cut via existing max-flow algorithms, we address the original problem via solving a series of graph cuts. We rigorously prove that ITEM has a parameterized constant approximation ratio. Inspired by the optimal stopping theory, we further design an online algorithm called OPTS, based on optimally alternating between partial and full placement updates. Our evaluations with real-world data traces demonstrate that ITEM performs close to the optimum (within 5\%) and converges fast. OPTS achieves a bounded performance as expected while reducing full updates by more than 67\% of the time.}

        abstract = {Insider spielen f{\"u}r ihre Umgebung eine zentrale Rolle bei der Erf{\"u}llung von Aufgaben, Erbringung von Leistungen oder Aufrechterhaltung von Diensten. Spezielle F{\"a}higkeiten, die Insidern eine herausgehobene Stellung gegen{\"u}ber Outsidern verleihen, k{\"o}nnen allerdings auch einen gewollten oder versehentlichen negativen Einfluss aus{\"u}ben. Diese gleichzeitige Notwendigkeit auf der einen und Gefahr auf der anderen Seite, die sich in Insidern vereinen, er{\"o}ffnen ein komplexes Themenfeld, dass in seiner Problematik und Tragweite zunehmend an Bedeutung gewinnt.  In dieser Dissertation wird aufgezeigt, welche grundlegenden Probleme in der Forschung und Entwicklung von L{\"o}sungsans{\"a}tzen vorliegen, die Verbesserungen der Insiderproblematik im Weg stehen. Daf{\"u}r werden zun{\"a}chst neue Erkenntnisse im Grundlagenbereich der Insiderthematik erarbeitet und zu einer Insiderontologie zusammengef{\"u}hrt. Diese beinhaltet die Identifizierung der f{\"u}nf speziellen Insidercharakteristiken Credentials, Knowledge, Privileges, Trust sowie Uncertainty, mit denen die erw{\"a}hnten F{\"a}higkeiten von Insidern explizit benannt werden k{\"o}nnen. Die Insidercharakteristiken begr{\"u}nden jeweils unabh{\"a}ngige Insidertypen, die miteinander kombiniert eine eindeutige Beschreibung verschiedener Insider erlauben. Aus der Kombination von Insidertypen ergibt sich eine nat{\"u}rliche Insidertaxonomie, die als Grundlage f{\"u}r die Systematisierung von existierenden und zuk{\"u}nftigen Forschungsarbeiten dienen kann. Gleichzeitig wird der Unterschiedlichkeit von Insidern in verschiedenen Umgebungen Rechnung getragen, indem eine dynamische Insidermodellierung definiert wird. Aus den entwickelten Grundlagen, die sich zun{\"a}chst allein auf Insider im Allgemeinen beziehen, wird anschlie{\ss}end der Aspekt einer Insiderbedrohung im Detail herausgearbeitet, von welchem Insidertyp welche Art von Insiderbedrohung ausgeht. Daf{\"u}r werden die Insiderbedrohungen zun{\"a}chst in drei verschiedene Bedrohungsklassen strukturiert. Anschlie{\ss}end erfolgt eine detaillierte Betrachtung des Einflusses jeder Insidercharakteristik auf jede Insiderbedrohungsklasse. Die Ergebnisse erlauben eine Zuordnung der Insiderbedrohungen zu den Insidertypen der entwickelten Insidertaxonomie.  Neben den Grundlagen bez{\"u}glich Insidern und Insiderbedrohungen befasst sich die Dissertation auch mit Erkennungs- und Abwehrma{\ss}nahmen von Insiderbedrohungen. Zun{\"a}chst erfolgt ausgerichtet auf die Insidertaxonomie und die identifizierten Klassen von Insiderbedrohungen eine Zuordnung grundlegender Sicherheitsmechanismen zu den Bedrohungen durch einzelne Insidertypen. Dar{\"u}ber hinaus wird ein neuer Ansatz zur detaillierten Erfassung und Analyse von Insideraktivit{\"a}ten in IT-Umgebungen entworfen und umgesetzt. Dieser basiert auf Ereignisnachrichten aus der Systemaufrufebene von Betriebssystemen. Die Ereignisnachrichten werden in eine neuartige Graphenstruktur {\"u}berf{\"u}hrt, die eine signaturbasierte Erkennung und eine anschlie{\ss}ende Abwehr von bedrohlichen Insideraktivit{\"a}ten erm{\"o}glicht. Anhand von realen Angriffsproben wird zus{\"a}tzlich ein definiertes Insiderbedrohungsszenario ausgef{\"u}hrt und die neue Erkennungs- und Abwehrtechnik damit evaluiert. Die Ergebnisse zeigen Erkennungsraten von Insiderangriffsaktivit{\"a}ten im Bereich von 99,97\% und 100\%, wenn zuvor in einer Trainingsphase {\"a}hnlich gelagerte Aktivit{\"a}ten aufgezeichnet wurden.  Die in der Dissertation betrachteten Bedrohungsaspekte umfassen nicht nur solche, die von Insidern ausgehen, sondern auch jene, die auf Insider einwirken, wenn sie Erkennungs- und Abwehrtechniken ausgesetzt sind. Der dabei im Mittelpunkt stehende Insiderdatenschutz wird rechtlich eingeordnet und abschlie{\ss}end durch ein neu entwickeltes Pseudonymisierungsverfahren in die umgesetzte Erkennungs- und Abwehrtechnik integriert. Dabei liegt der Fokus sowohl auf der Erhaltung der Funktionalit{\"a}t, welche die Verkettbarkeit verschiedener Ereignisse sowie die Identifizierung von Akteuren anhand der Ereignisse umfasst, als auch auf einer technischen Durchsetzbarkeit der wichtigsten Datenschutz-Grundprinzipien, wie etwa der Datenminimierung, der Speicherbegrenzung sowie der Zweckbindung. Zum Einsatz kommen dabei kryptographische Funktionen, deren Kombination neu definierte Pseudonymisierungs-Schutzziele bereitstellen. Dazu z{\"a}hlen beispielsweise die Vertraulichkeit der personenbeziehbaren Daten, die pseudonymisiert werden sollen, oder die Limitierung der Verkettbarkeit verschiedener Ereignisse anhand der gew{\"a}hlten Pseudonyme. Dar{\"u}ber hinaus werden auch schutzw{\"u}rdige Aspekte herausgearbeitet, die sich erst aus der praktischen Umsetzung einer Pseudonymisierung ergeben.  Mithilfe der Ergebnisse dieser Dissertation k{\"o}nnen existierende und zuk{\"u}nftige Forschungs- und Entwicklungsarbeiten auf dem Gebiet der Insiderthematik systematisch aufbereitet und somit besser koordiniert werden. Daran ausgerichtet k{\"o}nnen weitere grundlegende Erkenntnisse erarbeitet und Synergieeffekte sowie Verbesserungen hervorgehoben werden. Die entwickelten Techniken zeigen dar{\"u}ber hinaus neue Wege f{\"u}r die Erkennung und Abwehr von Insiderbedrohungen auf. Gleichzeitig w{\"u}rdigen sie den Insiderdatenschutz und verdeutlichen, dass beides als mehrseitige Interessen und Pflichten ausbalanciert werden muss.},

        abstract = {Anonymity is an essential asset for a variety of communication systems, like humans? communication, the internet of things, and sensor networks. Establishing and maintaining such communication systems requires the exchange of information about their participants (called subjects). However, protecting anonymity reduces the availability of subject information, as these can be leveraged to break anonymity. Additionally, established techniques for providing anonymity often reduce the efficiency of communication networks. In this paper, we model four mechanisms to share routing information and discuss them with respect to their influence on anonymity and efficiency. While there is no ?one fits all? solution, there are suitable trade-offs to establish routing information complying with the technical capabilities of the subjects. Distributed solutions like decentralized lookup tables reduce routing information in messages at the cost of local memory consumption; other mechanisms like multi-layer encrypted path information come with higher communication overhead but reduce memory consumption for each subject.},

        abstract = {To the present day, the resilient operation of energy grids relies on the continuous supply of electricity provided by conglomerates of power plants, which adjust their production to the demand of the consumers. Transregional and international connections enable these conglomerates to maintain large amounts of reserve capacities for mitigating deviations from the crucial balance between demand and supply.   However, for years, energy grids have been undergoing drastic changes as part of the energy transition towards more economic and ecological smart grids. As a result, a growing amount of electricity is produced by increasingly volatile producers that are distributed throughout the energy grid. Furthermore, formerly passive consumers evolve to so-called prosumers capable of producing electricity locally. Whilst these changes support the goals of the energy transition, they also exacerbate the already challenging task of maintaining a continuous balance between the demand and supply of electricity and threaten the resilient operation of energy grids. This thesis makes the following three main contributions to improve the resilient operation of smart energy grids:  We propose a semi-formal model for structuring energy distribution grids as holarchies{--}dynamic hierarchies that facilitate the autonomous operation of sub-parts (holons). The resilient operation of these holons is improved by involving heterogeneous stakeholders into processes for mitigating the impact of hazardous situations on the continuous supply of electricity. Towards this end, our model empowers stakeholders to offer local resources dynamically as so-called flexibilities to support compensating deviations from the balance between demand and supply. We demonstrate our model by integrating it as a discrete-time simulation environment called HOLEG, which was developed as a part of this thesis. To assess the willingness of people to be increasingly involved in processes for mitigating hazardous situations in energy grids, an online survey was conducted. The results show that people are indeed willing to be more involved; however, numerous concerns related to IT-security and privacy remain.  The second main contribution addresses the combined technical challenge of organizing holons within holarchies and allocating available flexibilities to mitigate demand and supply deviations. First, we specify the joint challenge (In this work referred to as the Holon Problem) as a multivariate optimization problem and customize three prominent metaheuristic optimization approaches based on particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithms (GAs), and ant colony optimization (ACO) to find near-optimal solutions to the problem at hand. Towards this end, we propose and formalize a cost function that allows assessing the quality of solutions to the Holon Problem quantitatively, taking into account operational constraints of holonic energy grids as well as numerous ecological, economic, and resilience criteria. The three metaheuristics are evaluated within a simulated large-scale holonic distribution grid using the HOLEG simulation environment. The results show that metaheuristics are well-suited to find near-optimal solutions to the Holon Problem in situations with both, strict and relaxed time constraints. The final contribution deals with social challenges that emerge from operating energy grids as holarchies and involving people into processes for mitigating hazardous situations. First, we emphasize that knowledge about energy grid topics is a crucial component for people to become more aware and take on an increasingly responsible role within holonic energy grids. Second, we provide reasons why laypersons currently lack energy grid knowledge and discuss the potential benefits of increasing their domain knowledge about the resilient operation of energy grids. Third, we stress that knowledge{--}by itself{--}is insufficient to motivate people to become increasingly active and highlight strategies to increase their motivation based on monetary and non-monetary incentives. Finally, we propose a serious game prototype as a means to increase the knowledge of people about energy grid topics. The evaluation results show that the serious game prototype is well-suited to educate people about energy grid topics. Moreover, people experience the serious game as significantly more exciting, motivating, and entertaining compared to a text-based learning approach. In conclusion, this dissertation addresses both technical and social challenges that emerge from the transition of energy grids towards smart grids. Our contributions aid the understanding of sociotechnical interdependencies within future energy grids and advance concepts and methods to facilitate their resilient operation.},

        abstract = {Green networking is receiving attention to sustainable information and communication technology because it enables more energy-efficient networks and reduces environmental impact. Previous research made strides toward green development for network infrastructure by improving energy efficiency and leveraging renewable energy. In this thesis, we focused on green networking strategies to improve state-of-the-art telecommunication from a green perspective. We especially focused on the Internet protocol (IP) and content networking, which are indispensable core components of the current network designing and planning. The contributions of this thesis are as follows. Green IP routing. We designed an energy-efficient packet switching framework for green IP networking to reduce energy waste caused by dynamic changes in a network. The network is thereby partitioned into clusters consisting of one header node and several member nodes. Only the header node within a cluster performs the IP routing, and its member nodes put the routing-related functionality to sleep and conduct packet switching using a tag. We further investigated the performance impact of energy efficiency compared with the existing green solutions through simulations. Green content routing. To optimize content requests and caching toward green content delivery, we designed a content routing framework for green named data networking. We also introduced a quantitative metric for measuring the network?s environmental footprint to define the network node?s greenness and green path. Green paths encourage traffic to aggregate along routes powered by eco-friendly renewable energy. We evaluated the proposed approach?s performance through simulations of named data networking and green metrics under real topologies and their meteorological data followed by comparing the existing caching schemes. The performance of proposed approaches were evaluated through simulations using real Internet topologies, meteorological data, and energy metrics. The results indicated that applying the proposed green approaches to real networks achieves significant energy efficiency and environmental gains.},

However, students are often on their own during their practice sessions due to the limited time with their teachers, which increases the likelihood of mislearning playing techniques. To address this issue, we present Let's Frets - a modular guitar learning system that provides visual indicators and capturing of finger positions on a 3D-printed capacitive guitar fretboard. We based the design of Let's Frets on requirements collected through in-depth interviews with professional guitarists and teachers. In a user study (N=24), we evaluated the feedback modules of Let's Frets against fretboard charts. Our results show that visual indicators require the least time to realize new finger positions while a combination of visual indicators and \{position capturing\} yielded the highest playing accuracy. We conclude how Let's Frets enables independent practice sessions that can be translated to other musical instruments.}

        abstract = {Advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) have shaped today?s user services, enabling enhanced personalization and new kinds of support. As such AI-based services -- referred to as AI services in this thesis -- necessarily involve (potentially sensitive) user data, the resulting privacy implications are de facto the unacceptable face of this technology: data once provided, e.g., to AI services typically running in the provider's cloud or on (third-party) edge devices, may be used for other (often commercial) purposes than originally intended, even without the user's consent or awareness. While approaches to data protection are manifold, each of them makes a certain tradeoff between personalization, privacy, and applicability -- there is no practical one-size-fits-all solution.  This thesis explores a data decentralization approach in the context of personalized (single-user) AI services to achieve a more favorable tradeoff for users while considering the providers' interests. As a result, this work comprises seven (7) major contributions, two for the systematic understanding of data protection and privacy requirements in AI services, and five technical contributions -- of the latter, three contribute protection mechanisms based on data decentralization and two pave the way for a decentralized (urban) operation. Specifically, the first contribution presents a user study that explores user expectations of such data-demanding AI services and the extent to which privacy concerns arise. Based on these findings, the second contribution classifies the related work of data protection in AI services in a novel way, highlighting the identified research gaps -- some of which are addressed in this thesis, as outlined below.  While data decentralization promises users more control over their own data, it entails issues related to both efficiency and the protection of the provider's intellectual property due to the need for locally running AI services; this part of the thesis contributes three building blocks to address these issues: the third contribution of this thesis comprises a privacy-by-design platform, which relies on an open architecture and decentralized data-confining personal data stores with design and runtime support for AI services running locally to access user data; it forms the basis for the following building blocks. The fourth contribution adds a building block to ensure confidential processing of user data locally by AI services while protecting providers' intellectual property, even when both are offloaded to untrusted (third-party) edge devices. The fifth contribution adds a building block to address the cold-start problem and efficiency issues (e.g., caused by labeling effort for users, local resource use) specifically of AI services relying on supervised learning algorithms in local personalization.  To support mobile users in coping with resource-intensive, latency-demanding AI services and provide ambient support to them not only at home, the last part of this thesis enables a city-wide, decentralized operation of this platform. The sixth contribution presents two economic (edge computing) infrastructure concepts, which propose to exploit existing (but originally for other purposes used) infrastructures that are predestined for this: one is based on publicly-owned augmented street lamps; the other relies on a sharing concept of privately-owned wireless home routers and their LAN-connected home resources. The seventh and last contribution adds a proactive deployment mechanism to efficiently conceal the inherent initialization overhead of (personalized, data-protected) AI services on nearby edge devices for mobile users.  A series of evaluations on sample AI services provides the proof of the proposed concepts---confirming the achieved unique tradeoff between personalization, privacy, and applicability.},

These representations may capture the control flow of the process as well as the context a case is executed in. However, most of these representations are hand-crafted, which is very time-consuming for practical use, and the incorporation of event and case attributes as contextual factors is challenging. In this paper, we propose a neural network architecture for representation learning to automate the generation. Our network is trained in a supervised fashion to learn the most meaningful features to obtain highly dense and accurate vector representations of cases of an event log. We implemented our approach and conducted experiments in the context of trace clustering with publicly available event logs to show its applicability. The results show improvements regarding the separation of cases, and that process models discovered from identified subsets are of high quality.},

Thus, the internal states of the audience directly influence the staging. Artists can have a more direct perception of the inner reactions of audience members and can create physical expressions in response to them. In this paper, we present the wearable sensing system as well as design considerations of mapping heart and electrodermal activity to changes in the staging elements. We evaluated our design and setup over three live performances.}

        abstract = {Complex Event Processing (CEP) is a powerful paradigm for scalable data management that is employed in many real-world scenarios such as detecting credit card fraud in banks. The so-called complex events are expressed using a specification language that is typically implemented and executed on a specific runtime system. While the tight coupling of these two components has been regarded as the key for supporting CEP at high performance, such dependencies pose several inherent challenges as follows. (1) Application development atop a CEP system requires extensive knowledge of how the runtime system operates, which is typically highly complex in nature. (2) The specification language dependence requires the need of domain experts and further restricts and steepens the learning curve for application developers. In this paper, we propose CEPLESS, a scalable data management system that decouples the specification from the runtime system by building on the principles of serverless computing. CEPLESS provides ?operator as a service? and offers flexibility by enabling the development of CEP application in any specification language while abstracting away the complexity of the CEP runtime system. As part of CEPLESS, we designed and evaluated novel mechanisms for in-memory processing and batching that enable the stateful processing of CEP operators even under high rates of ingested events. Our evaluation demonstrates that CEPLESS can be easily integrated into existing CEP systems like Apache Flink while attaining similar throughput under high scale of events (up to 100K events per second) and dynamic operator update in ?238 ms.},

This prevents researchers from testing detection and tracking mechanisms on potential future threats. Specifically, in the domain of P2P botnets, the protocol specifics, network churn and anti-tracking mechanisms greatly impact the success or failure of monitoring operations.  Moreover, experiments on real world botnets, commonly lack ground truth to verify the findings. As developing and deploying botnets of sufficient size is accompanied by large costs and administration efforts, this paper attempts to address this issue by introducing a simulation framework for P2P botnets called Botnet Simulation Framework (BSF). BSF can simulate monitoring operations in botnets of more than 20.000 bots to evaluate tracking mechanisms or simulate takedown efforts. Moreover, communication traces can be exported to inject traffic into arbitrary PCAP files for training and evaluation of intrusion detection systems.},

Through two experiments, we systematically investigate vibrotactile perception on the wrist, forearm, upper arm, back, torso, thigh, and leg, each in transverse and longitudinal body orientation. In the first experiment, we address the maximum distance between vibration motors that still preserves the ability to generate phantom sensations. In the second experiment, we investigate the perceptual accuracy of localizing vibrations in order to establish the minimum distance between vibration motors. Based on the results, we derive VibroMap, a spatial map of the functional range of inter-motor distances across the body. VibroMap supports hardware and interaction designers with design guidelines for constructing body-worn vibrotactile displays.}

           title = {Process Learning for Autonomous Process Anomaly Correction},
           month = {Dezember},
            year = {2020},
        abstract = {The automatic detection of divergences from a desired process behavior is a common research topic in the business process management community. An established technique to analyze processes is called conformance checking. Given a definition of a process in form of a process model, conformance checking can be used to test whether the executions of a process contained in a so-called event log data structure are conforming with the process as it was defined. The result is a comparison of the execution traces and their respective correct execution, according to the process model. This technique provides insights into where the divergence has occurred and how the execution must be altered to conform to the process model. However, a problem is that it requires a process model to be available. Process models in the correct format are not always available.  Contrary to conformance checking, process anomaly detection aims to find anomalous executions without relying on a predefined process model. A process anomaly detection algorithm derives the process logic from the event log itself and exploits the patterns found within the event log to distinguish normal from anomalous process executions. Though process anomaly detection provides the benefit of not relying on a process model, it typically does not provide the level of detail that conformance checking does. A process execution can either be normal or it can be anomalous.  This dissertation proposes process anomaly correction, a novel approach that combines the benefits of conformance checking and process anomaly detection. Given only an event log, process anomaly correction detects anomalous executions, clearly indicates where the anomaly has occurred during the execution and suggests possible corrective measures. The solution presented in this work is based on a new concept to the field of process anomaly detection: Process learning. In process learning, the task of understanding the process based on the example data is transformed into a learning problem in which a neural network is trained to predict the very next activity in a running process execution. The resulting machine learning model thus represents an approximation of the real process that created the data.  This cumulative dissertation consists of five contributions to the field of business process management that demonstrate how, starting from a process anomaly detection, process anomaly correction is achieved in a series of four steps. (1) Process learning is employed to generate an approximated model of the process logic.  (2) The limitation of only distinguishing between normal and anomalous process executions is overcome by employing the process learning model which processes the process executions on a finer level of detail than existing approaches.  (3) The necessity of providing manual threshold settings, as it is typical for process anomaly detection algorithms, is replaced by an automatic parameterization utilizing the process learning model. (4) The predictive capabilities of the process learning model are exploited to generate possible corrections of detected anomalies.  The resulting process anomaly correction approach can be employed in scenarios where classic conformance checking would be infeasible, due to the restriction of relying on a process model. Furthermore, it can be employed alongside classical conformance checking, for it incorporates more information coming from the event log than classical conformance checking (such as employees executing a process step, in which country the process is executed, etc.), and thus provides a new perspective for the process analyst.},

We found that visitors consider their relation to the IoT device owner and familiarity with the environment and IoT devices when making decisions about data sharing that affect their privacy. Overall, the visitors of smart environments demonstrated similar privacy preferences like the owners of IoT devices but lacked means to judge consequences of data collection and means to express their privacy preferences.

        abstract = {Maintaining the continuous supply of electricity within smart microgrids is a challenging task, which becomes increasingly difficult with the growing integration of volatile Renewable Energy Sources (RES). Quick changes within the production behavior of these resources can disturb the necessary balance between demand and supply and may ultimately lead to blackouts within the grid. To prevent balance disturbances, electricity production and consumption needs to be coordinated and power needs to be shared among the participants within the microgrid. Facilitating coordinated behavior of grid entities and ensuring reliable operation of the microgrid in the presence of volatile RES requires sophisticated strategies for operating individual participants. In this paper, we present a modular framework to support dynamic energy distribution for atomic entities (producers/consumers) in holarchically organized energy grids. In particular, the framework provides production and consumption forecasting to enable intelligent strategy selection to improve the day-ahead control decisions for atomic entities. The proposed framework enables the bottom-up formation of smart mircogrid holons and represents a foundation for the formation and strategic coordination of participants in smart microgrid.}

        abstract = {IoT devices no longer affect single users only because others like visitors or family members - denoted as bystanders - might be in the device?s vicinity. Thus, data about bystanders can be collected by IoT devices and bystanders can observe what IoT devices output. To better understand how this affects the privacy of IoT device owners and bystanders and how their privacy can be protected better, we interviewed 42 young adults. Our results include that owners of IoT devices wish to adjust the device output when visitors are present. Visitors wish to be made aware of the data collected about them, to express their privacy needs, and to take measures. Based on our results, we show demand for scalable solutions that address the tension that arises between the increasing discreetness of IoT devices, their increase in numbers and the requirement to preserve the self-determination of owners and bystanders at the same time.},

        abstract = {This paper presents a brainstorming tool combined with pointing gestures to improve the brainstorming meeting experience for blind and visually impaired people (BVIP). In brainstorming meetings, BVIPs are not able to participate in the conversation as well as sighted users because of the unavailability of supporting tools for understanding the explicit and implicit meaning of the non-verbal communication (NVC). Therefore, the proposed system assists BVIP in interpreting pointing gestures which play an important role in non-verbal communication. Our system will help BVIP to access the contents of a Metaplan card, a team member in the brainstorming meeting is referring to by pointing. The prototype of our system shows that targets on the screen a user is pointing at can be detected with 80\% accuracy.},

        abstract = {In recent years, assistive technology and digital accessibility for blind and visually impaired people (BVIP) has been significantly improved. Yet, group discussions, especially in a business context, are still challenging as non-verbal communication (NVC) is often depicted on digital whiteboards, including deictic gestures paired with visual artifacts. However, as NVC heavily relies on the visual perception, whichrepresents a large amount of detail, an adaptive approach is required that identifies the most relevant information for BVIP. Additionally, visual artifacts usually rely on spatial properties such as position, orientation, and dimensions to convey essential information such as hierarchy, cohesion, and importance that is often not accessible to the BVIP. In this paper, we investigate the requirements of BVIP during brainstorming sessions and, based on our findings, provide an accessible multimodal tool that uses non-verbal and spatial cues as an additional layer of information. Further, we contribute by presenting a set of input and output modalities that encode and decode information with respect to the individual demands of BVIP and the requirements of different use cases.}

        abstract = {In this article, we investigate a fundamental question regarding software security: Is the security of SW releases increasing over time? We approach this question with a detailed analysis of the large body of open-source software packaged in the popular Debian GNU/Linux distribution. Contrary to common intuition, we find no clear evidence that the vulnerability rate of widely used software decreases over time: Even in popular and ?stable? releases, the fixing of bugs does not seem to reduce the rate of newly identified vulnerabilities. The intuitive conclusion is worrisome: Commonly employed development and validation procedures do not seem to scale with the increase of features and complexity{--}they are only chopping pieces off the top of an iceberg of vulnerabilities.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation into the problem that studies a complete distribution of software, spanning multiple versions. Although we can not give a definitive answer, we show that several popular beliefs also cannot be confirmed given our dataset. We publish our Debian Vulnerability Analysis Framework (DVAF), an automated dataset creation and analysis process, to enable reproduction and further analysis of our results. Overall, we hope our contributions provide important insights into the vulnerability discovery process and help in identifying effective techniques for vulnerability analysis and prevention.}

        abstract = {Machine learning based anomaly detection mechanisms are a promising tool to detect and protect networks from previously unknown attacks. The quality of those mechanisms strongly depends on the availability of large amounts of data for their training and evaluation. However, suitable datasets are scarce, as they are rarely shared by those who possess them. This impedes progress in the development and deployment of sophisticated machine learning mechanisms. This paper aims to accelerate this thwarted development process by introducing a network simulation framework for training-data generation and evaluation of data-driven mechanisms, like anomaly detection approaches. The framework enables training, testing, and evaluating data-driven approaches in a safe and extensible environment prior to their deployment in real-world systems. We showcase the capabilities of the framework in a case study. For this, a smart home network is modeled and simulated within the framework. The generated data is used to train an anomaly detection approach, which is then used to detect various anomalies introduced by attacks on the network. This ability to train and evaluate data-driven algorithms within the framework allows users to accelerate the otherwise time-consuming cycle of deploying, modifying, and re-training in live environments, which ultimately advances the development of novel anomaly detection approaches.}

        abstract = {Most enterprises and organizations have digitized their work by implementing process-aware information systems. These systems typically record a large amount of event data about the organization's day-to-day business. Organizations are interested in analyzing this data to optimize their business processes. Process mining is a research field that analyzes event data to obtain valuable knowledge about how processes are executed in reality. Different from conventional interview-based methods, process mining analyzes the process performance and compliance solely based on recorded event data.  Currently, the work of analysts using process mining tools is characterized as largely manual, leading to many ad-hoc tasks. With the growth of available event data and the increasing complexity of processes, several issues emerge in practice. Many process mining methods are not specifically designed for large event logs, leading to high computation time and a substantial amount of manual work. Consequently, suitable subsets of cases must be selected before applying certain analysis tasks successfully. Furthermore, applying process mining techniques to unknown event data often requires extensive domain knowledge and process mining expertise to obtain valuable insights. Although efforts were made to systematize the manual work of analysts in process mining projects, current tools lack intelligent computer-assisted guidance.  This dissertation introduces several contributions to different steps along an analyst's workflow to address the above issues. It is divided into three major parts: The first part introduces a process knowledge artifact framework that simplifies data extraction and processing of heterogeneous data sources as an enabling preparatory step towards process mining. In the second part, the dissertation introduces three algorithms specifically designed for large and complex real-life event logs. A novel compliance checking algorithm significantly improves runtime performance for large event logs to identify compliance rule violations. A parameter-free process drift detection algorithm automatically detects changes in the process execution over time to reveal potential process issues. A novel multi-perspective trace clustering algorithm automatically detects patterns in the control flow and the data perspective of a process to reveal the different process behaviors in event logs, aiming at simplifying process discovery. The third part of the dissertation integrates the contributions made in the first two parts and introduces an interactive visual recommendation approach to enhance process analysis guidance. Lastly, a process improvement approach is presented, suggesting modifications to process models for a given improvement goal.  The proposed algorithms and methods were evaluated with synthetic and real-life event logs, demonstrating their superior qualitative performance and practical feasibility. A user study conducted with process mining experts evaluated the prototype implementation of the interactive visual recommendation system to assess the usefulness in the process analysis workflow.},

We validate our approach with a variety of simulations using real network topology and renewable energy datasets from the US, and the results show that applying the proposed green NDN achieves significant ecofriendly gains.},

This improved realism is attributed to today's ability to increasingly appeal to human sensations, such as visual, auditory or tactile. While research also examines temperature sensation as an important aspect, the interdependency of visual and thermal perception in VR is still underexplored. In this paper, we propose Therminator, a thermal display concept that provides warm and cold on-body feedback in VR through heat conduction of flowing liquids with different temperatures. Further, we systematically evaluate the interdependency of different visual and thermal stimuli on the temperature perception of arm and abdomen with 25 participants. As part of the results, we found varying temperature perception depending on the stimuli, as well as increasing involvement of users during conditions with matching stimuli.},

In this paper, we present the first steps towards an open framework to create a VR locomotion benchmark. As a viability study, we investigate how well the users move in VR when using three different locomotion mechanics. It was played in over 124 sessions across 10 countries in a period of three weeks. The included prototype locomotion mechanics are arm swing,walk-in-place and trackpad movement. We found that over-all, users performed significantly faster using arm swing and trackpad when compared to walk-in-place. For subjective preference, arm swing was significantly more preferred over the other two methods. Finally for induced sickness, walk-in-place was the overall most sickness-inducing locomotion method.},

In this paper, we explore lateral shifts of the walking path as a hands-free input modality. The available input options are visualized as lanes on the ground parallel to the user's walking path. Users can select options by shifting the walking path sideways to the respective lane. We contribute the results of a controlled experiment with 18 participants, confirming the viability of our approach for fast, accurate, and joyful interactions. Further, based on the findings of the controlled experiment, we present three example applications.}

The object bottom contains a uniform grid of conductive dots that are connected to a unique embedded structure inside the item. Based on the interaction with the item, different dots turn into touch-points and form an authentication pattern. This pattern can be recognized by a capacitive touchscreen. Based on an expert design study, we present an interaction space with six categories of possible authentication interactions. In a user study, we demonstrate the feasibility of 3D-Auth items and show that the items are easy to use and the interactions are easy to remember.},

        abstract = {The progressing digitalization increases the demand for interactive devices that bridge the physical and digital world. While there is great potential for customized interactive devices tailored to specific applications or users, until recently, integrating interactivity in custom devices required pre-defined components (e.g., rectangular buttons or flat touchscreens) that constrains the shape of the device. A more flexible alternative has opened up with the advent of 3D printing which empowers companies, developers, and end users to design and fabricate custom-shaped individual objects on demand with relatively low effort. Even though recognized as revolutionizing the manufacturing process, the 3D printing of custom-made interactive devices still requires novel sensor concepts, that operate on complex geometries, and significant design or assembly effort.  This thesis concerns the 3D printing of interactive input devices that respond to a variety of external stimuli and are printed in a single pass without requiring significant assembly steps. It consists of the following five major contributions: The first contribution is a fabrication pipeline to design and 3D print custom-shaped touch sensors on complex 3D objects. Then, the second contribution extends the first pipeline to detect hovering, touching, or pressing of a finger on a 3D-printed object. The third contribution continues to explore deformation-aware 3D-printed objects that detect pressure, squeeze, and bending in combination with a capacitive touchscreen. The fourth contribution adds liquid to 3D-printed objects to detect tilting and motion interactions. Based on these liquid-filled objects,  the fifth contribution is an alternative sensing approach that does not require powered electronics during the interaction. Instead, each sensor concept memorizes the effect of a pre-defined external stimulus by changes in its internal structure. These changes can be read-out at a later time through a capacitive touchscreen. A series of evaluations and applications show the feasibility and broad applicability of all contributions for 3D printing of custom-made interactive devices.}

        abstract = {Recent technological advances have made head-mounted displays (HMDs) smaller and untethered, fostering the vision of ubiquitous interaction with information in a digitally augmented physical world. For interacting with such devices, three main types of input - besides not very intuitive finger gestures - have emerged so far: 1) Touch input on the frame of the devices or 2) on accessories (controller) as well as 3) voice input. While these techniques have both advantages and disadvantages depending on the current situation of the user, they largely ignore the skills and dexterity that we show when interacting with the real world: Throughout our lives, we have trained extensively to use our limbs to interact with and manipulate the physical world around us.  This thesis explores how the skills and dexterity of our upper and lower limbs, acquired and trained in interacting with the real world, can be transferred to the interaction with HMDs. Thus, this thesis develops the vision of around-body interaction, in which we use the space around our body, defined by the reach of our limbs, for fast, accurate, and enjoyable interaction with such devices. This work contributes four interaction techniques, two for the upper limbs and two for the lower limbs: The first contribution shows how the proximity between our head and hand can be used to interact with HMDs. The second contribution extends the interaction with the upper limbs to multiple users and illustrates how the registration of augmented information in the real world can support cooperative use cases. The third contribution shifts the focus to the lower limbs and discusses how foot taps can be leveraged as an input modality for HMDs. The fourth contribution presents how lateral shifts of the walking path can be exploited for mobile and hands-free interaction with HMDs while walking.}

        abstract = {The new paradigm of Edge Computing aims to bring resources for storage and computations closer to end devices, alleviating stress on core networks and enabling low-latency mobile applications. While Cloud Computing carries out processing in large centralized data centers, Edge Computing leverages smaller-scale resources{--} often termed cloudlets{--}in the vicinity of users. Edge Computing is expected to support novel applications (e.g., mobile augmented reality) and the growing number of connected devices (e.g., from the domain of the Internet of Things). Today, however, we lack essential building blocks for the widespread public availability of Edge Computing, especially in urban environments. This thesis makes several contributions to the understanding, planning, deployment, and operation of Urban Edge Computing infrastructures. We start from a broad perspective by conducting a thorough analysis of the field of Edge Computing, systematizing use cases, discussing potential benefits, and analyzing the potential of Edge Computing for different types of applications. We propose re-using existing physical infrastructures (cellular base stations, WiFi routers, and augmented street lamps) in an urban environment to provide computing resources by upgrading those infrastructures with cloudlets. On the basis of a real-world dataset containing the location of those infrastructures and mobility traces of two mobile applications, we conduct the first large-scale measurement study of urban cloudlet coverage with four different metrics for coverage. After having shown the viability of using those existing infrastructures in an urban environment, we make an algorithmic contribution to the problem of which locations to upgrade with cloudlets, given the heterogeneous nature (with regards to communication range, computing resources, and costs) of the underlying infrastructure. Our proposed solution operates locally on grid cells and is able to adapt to the desired tradeoff between the quality of service and costs for the deployment. Using a simulation experiment on the same mobility traces, we show the effectiveness of our strategy. Existing mechanisms for computation offloading typically achieve loose coupling between the client device and the computing resources by requiring prior transfers of heavyweight execution environments. In light of this deficiency, we propose the concept of store-based microservice onloading, embedded in a flexible runtime environment for Edge Computing. Our runtime environment operates on a microservice-level granularity and those services are made available in a repository{--}the microservice store{--}and, upon request from a client, transferred from the store to execution agents at the edge. Furthermore, our Edge Computing runtime is able to share running instances with multiple users and supports the seamless definition and execution of service chains through distributed message queues. Empirical measurements of the implemented approach showed up to 13 times reduction in the end-to-end latency and energy savings of up to 94 \% for the mobile device. We provide three contributions regarding strategies and adaptations of an Edge Computing system at runtime. Existing strategies for the placement of data and computation components are not adapted to the requirements of a heterogeneous (e.g., with regards to varying resources) edge environment. The placement of functional parts of an application is a core component of runtime decisions. This problem is computationally hard and has been insufficiently explored for service chains whose topologies are typical for Edge Computing environments (e.g., with regards to the location of data sources and sinks). To this end, we present two classes of heuristics that make the problem more tractable. We implement representatives for each class and show how they substantially reduce the time it takes to find a solution to the placement problem, while introducing only a small optimality gap. The placement of data (e.g., such captured by mobile devices) in Edge Computing should take into account the user?s context and the possible intent of sharing this data. Especially in the case of overloaded networks, e.g., during large-scale events, edge infrastructure can be beneficial for data storage and local dissemination. To address this challenge, we propose vStore, a middleware that{--}based on a set of rules{--}decouples applications from pre-defined storage locations in the cloud. We report on results from a field study with a demonstration application, showing that we were able to reduce cloud storage in favor of proximate micro-storage at the edge. As a final contribution, we explore the adaptation possibilities of microservices themselves. We suggest to make microservices adaptable in three dimensions: (i) in the algorithms they use to perform a certain task, (ii) in their parameters, and (iii) in auxiliary data that is required. These adaptations can be leveraged to trade a faster execution time for a decreased quality of the computation (e.g., by producing more inaccurate or partly wrong results). We argue that this is an important building block to be included in an Edge Computing system in view of both constrained resources and strict requirements on computation latencies. We conceptualize an adaptable microservice execution framework and define the problem of choosing the service variant, building upon the design of our previously introduced Edge Computing runtime environment. For a case study, we implement representative examples (e.g., in the field of computer vision and image processing) and outline the practical influence of the abovementioned tradeoff. In conclusion, this dissertation systematically analyzes the field of Urban Edge Computing, thereby contributing to its general understanding. Our contributions provide several important building blocks for the realization of a public Edge Computing infrastructure in an urban environment.}

This discrepancy between physical and virtual dimensions renders traditional locomotion methods used in real world unfeasible. To alleviate these limitations, research proposed various artificial locomotion concepts such as teleportation, treadmills, and redirected walking. However, these concepts occupy the user's hands, require complex hardware or large physical spaces. In this paper, we contribute nine VR locomotion concepts for foot-based and hands-free locomotion, relying on the 3D position of the user's feet and the pressure applied to the sole as input modalities. We evaluate our concepts and compare them to state-of-the-art point \& teleport technique in a controlled experiment with 20 participants. The results confirm the viability of our approaches for hands-free and engaging locomotion. Further, based on the findings, we contribute a wireless hardware prototype implementation.},

Its application on data records, especially in an environment with additional constraints, like re-identification in the course of incident response, implies assumptions and privacy issues, which contradict the achievement of the desirable privacy level. Proceeding from two real-world scenarios, where personal and identifying data needs to be processed, we identify a system model for pseudonymisation and explicitly state the sustained privacy threats. With this system and threat model, we derive privacy protection goals together with possible technical realisations, which are integrated into our event pseudonymisation framework PEEPLL for the context of event processing, like auditing of user activities. Our framework provides privacy-friendly linkability in order to maintain the possibility for automatic event correlation and evaluation, while at the same time reduces the privacy impact on individuals. With this framework, privacy provided by event pseudonymisation can be enhanced by a more rigorous commitment to the concept of personal data minimisation.},

Nonetheless, many IoT devices suffer from the absence, or the bad application, of security concepts, which leads to severe vulnerabilities in those devices. To achieve early detection of potential vulnerabilities, network scanner tools are frequently used. However, most of those tools are highly specialized; thus, multiple tools and a meaningful correlation of their results are required to obtain an adequate listing of identified network vulnerabilities. To simplify this process, we propose a modular framework for automated network reconnaissance and vulnerability indication in IP-based networks. It allows integrating a diverse set of tools as either, scanning tools or analysis tools. Moreover, the framework enables result aggregation of different modules and allows information sharing between modules facilitating the development of advanced analysis modules. Additionally, intermediate scanning and analysis data is stored, enabling a historical view of derived information and also allowing users to retrace decision-making processes. We show the framework?s modular capabilities by implementing one scanner module and three analysis modules. The automated process is then evaluated using an exemplary scenario with common IP-based IoT components.},

In recent years, internet access has moved from wired connections to a substantial amount of wireless communication. Although the link layer is evolving, higher network layers do not. Hence, most wireless communication is handled by standard TCP/IP stacks, even though TCP does not perform to its best on wireless links. Additionally, TCP offers partially redundant services to the link layer, as it is possible to ensure reliability and in-order-delivery in managed wireless technologies (such as LTE). These problems lead to underutilized wireless links and not optimal user experience. In this paper, we present UDP++, an adaptable transport layer protocol for managed wireless links. UDP++ offers a feature set to achieve TCP-like transport layer communication. Thereby any feature is optional and configurable at runtime, to ensure a perfect match between application requirements and the communication link, without unnecessary services. This results in better quality of service outcomes, reduced overhead traffic, and less CPU utilization. Our evaluation show around 45  less end-to-end latency and around 30  less overhead traffic compared to the de-facto standard TCP.},

        abstract = {Today, one in eleven adults is suffering from diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus is a disease where the body's own insulin control system fails. Incorrectly treated diabetes mellitus will lead to serious complications like strokes, blindness, and ultimately, death. Too high or too low blood glucose levels are dangerous, an insulin over-dose can even be lethal. Hence, the correct dosage of insulin from diabetes patients is the key parameter in therapy. Therefore, the patients get educated regularly by diabetes experts. These training sessions contain data review by the experts in order to identify errors in the patients' dosage behavior. However, this review is time consuming, since the error identification for a wrong dosage is nontrivial. In this paper we investigate the automatic classification of insulin dosage into three categories, representing correctly applied therapy and the most common therapy faults. We provide the experts with a pre-classified overview of the data, where the common errors are visually highlighted. This saves time in the consultation hour, enabling the expert to spend more time on investigating the patients individual problems. In our evaluation we compare multiple classification methods based on dynamic time warping against a convolutional neural network. The results show, that the convolutional neural network can achieve accuracy levels that are promising, although further improvements are required.}

        abstract = {In times of cloud services and IoT, network protocol processing is a big part of the CPU utilization today. Foong et al. proposed the rule of thumb for TCP, that a single-core CPU needs about 1 Hz clock frequency to produce 1 bit/s worth of TCP data packets. Unfortunately, CPU speed has stagnated around 5 GHz in recent years resulting in a upper limit of 5 GBit/s throughput with single-threaded network processing. Further, CPU featuring such high clock rates (e.g., Intel Core i7-8086K) have rated TDP around 95 W, resulting in very high power consumption for high throughput situations. Meanwhile, industry offers some hardware acceleration for TCP as part of their server network cards, to relief the server CPUs and increase the energy efficiency. However this is just a small support as state and management still needs the CPU of the host system. In this paper, we present an approach based on field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) to not only free up CPU cycles but provide a scaleable and energy efficient concept to fully utilize high-speed network interfaces, whereby maintaining the flexibility of software solutions. For our evaluation, we utilized the NetFPGA Sume, proofing to achieve the linerate of connected SFP+ ports while power consumption stays below 6 W. By leveraging the network protocol virtualization, the hardware acceleration approach is not only deploy-able but stays flexible enough to adapt new networking paradigms quickly.},

CEP provides semantic units called operators e.g., filter and join, that collectively represent a complex event. In current CEP systems, operators are highly dependent on the programming language and the underlying server. This restricts the capability of provisioning user-defined operators at runtime as well as the flexibility of developing server agnostic custom operators.  In this paper, we provide a serverless CEP architecture, which offers developers the flexibility to design operators in any language and integrate them at runtime. We embed operators in the function as a service model of serverless architecture. This is very beneficial for applications such as financial fraud detection where complex machine learning operators must be integrated at runtime to avoid service disruption. We show using our preliminary evaluation that only with minimal overhead in latency, we can offer highly flexible server agnostic CEP operators.},

        abstract = {Time and time again the security community has faced novel threats that were previously never analyzed, sometimes with catastrophic results. To avoid this, proactive analysis of envisioned threats is of great importance. One such threat is blockchain-based botnets. Bitcoin, and blockchain-based decentralized cryptocurrencies in general, promise a fair and more transparent financial system. They do so by implementing an open and censorship-resistant atomic broadcast protocol that enables the maintenance of a global transaction ledger, known as a blockchain. In this paper, we consider how this broadcast protocol may be used for malicious behavior as a botnet command and control (C2) channel. Botmasters have been known to misuse broadcasting platforms, like social media, as C2 channels. However, these platforms lack the integral censorship-resistant property of decentralized cryptocurrencies. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive systematization of knowledge study on using blockchains as botnet C2 channels, generating a number of important insights. We set off by providing a critical analysis of the state of the art of blockchain-based botnets, along with an abstract model of such a system. We then examine the inherent limitations of the design, in an attempt to challenge the feasibility of such a botnet. With such limitations in mind, we move forward with an experimental analysis of the detectability of such botnets and discuss potential countermeasures. Contrary to previous work that proposed such botnets, we provide a broad overview of the associated risk and view the problem in relation to other existing botnet C2 channels. We conclude that despite its limitations, the blockchain, as a backup mechanism, practically renders attempts to suppress the control channel of a botnet futile. Thus, more focus should be put on detecting and disinfecting machines at the network edge (router) or even per-bot level.},

        abstract = {Edge computing brings computing and storage resources closer to (mobile) end users and data sources, thus bypassing expensive and slow links to distant cloud computing infrastructures. Often leveraged opportunistically, these heterogeneous resources can be used to offload data and computations, enabling upcoming demanding applications such as augmented reality and autonomous driving. Research in this direction has addressed various challenges, from architectural concerns to runtime optimizations. As of today, however, we lack a widespread availability of edge computing{--}partly because it remains unclear which of the promised benefits of edge computing are relevant for what types of applications. This article provides a comprehensive snapshot of the current edge computing landscape, with a focus on the application perspective. We outline the characteristics of edge computing and its postulated benefits and drawbacks. To understand the functional composition of applications, we first define common application components that are relevant w.r.t. edge computing. We then present a classification of proposed use cases and analyze them according to their expected benefits from edge computing and which components they use. Furthermore, we illustrate existing products and industry solutions that have recently surfaced and outline future research challenges.}

To achieve early detection of vulnerabilities, network scanner tools are frequently used.

        abstract = {Machine learning models are subject to changing circumstances, and will degrade over time. Nowadays, data are collected in vast amounts: Personal data is retrieved by our phones, by our internet browser, via our shopping behavior, and especially through all the content that we upload to social media platforms. Machines in factories, cars, essentially every device that is not purely mechanical anymore, may be also collecting data. This data is often used to build predictive models, e.g., for recommender systems or remaining lifetime estimation. As all things in life, the data and the knowledge extracted from a person or machine is subject to change, which is called concept drift. This concept drift may be caused by varying circumstances, changes in the expected outcome, or completely new requirements for the task. In any case, to keep a model operative, adaptive learning mechanisms are required to deal with the drift. Related works in this area cover a plethora of adaptive learning mechanisms. Usually, these algorithms are made to learn on streams of data from scratch. However, we argue that in many real-world scenarios this type of learning does not fit the actual application. It is rather, that stationary models are trained in a sandbox environment on large datasets, which are then put into practical use. If these models are not specifically constructed to be adaptive, any concept drift will lower the performance. Since training such a model, e.g., a deep neural network, can be expensive in regards of cost and time required, it is desirable to use it as long as possible. We introduce a new paradigm of adapting existing models. Our goal is to keep the existing models as long as possible, and only adapt it to the concept drift where it is necessary. We solve this by computing partial adaptations, so called patches. Via this mechanism, we can assure the existing model to live longer, and keep the learning required for adaptation to a minimum. The Patching mechanism elongates the lifetime of a machine learned model, helps to adapt with fewer observed instances, aids in individualizing an existing model, and generally increases the models? cost efficiency. In this dissertation we first introduce a general framework for learn- ing patches as adaptation mechanisms. We evaluate the concept, and compare it against state of the art stream learning mechanisms. When dealing with normal stream scenarios, it is reasonable to apply Patch- ing. However, when dealing with scenarios which it is intended for, Patching excels in adaptation speed and overall performance. In a second contribution we specialize the patching idea on neural networks. Since neural networks are expensive and time consuming in training, we require a way of adapting them quickly. Although neural networks can be adapted via the normal training process, training them with newer data can lead to side effects such as catastrophic forgetting. Depending on the size and complexity of the network, adapting them can also be either expensive or{--}when given only few examples{--}unsuccessful. We propose neural network patching (NN- Patching) as a solution to this issue. In NN-Patching, the underlying network remains unchanged. However, a neural patch is trained by using the inner activations of the base network. These represent latent features that can be useful towards the given task. An error estimator network determines, whether the patch network or the base network is better suited to classify an instance. NN-Patching shows even more significant improvements than Patching, with quick adaptation and overall adaptive capabilities that rival those of the theoretically more capable competition. The final contribution is geared towards the use in scenarios that require model individualization or deal with re-occuring concepts. For this task we propose Ensemble Patching, a variant of Patching that builds an ensemble of patches. These patches are learned in such a way, that they each cover a distinctive type of concept drift. When a new concept emerges, a certain error pattern will occur for the base classifier. A specific patch is then learned. All ensemble members are managed via a recurrent network called the ensemble conductor. This separately trained model will conduct the ensemble decision, and is the key player for the adaptation. When concepts become outdated, the conductor will put less weight on the decisions of the respective patches, but by its structure it can quickly reactivate them, should older concepts become relevant again. Our evaluation demonstrates that this ensemble technique handles recurring concepts very well. Ensemble Patching can also be employed in a stream classification scenario, where computational efficiency is important.}

Due to the highly competitive pressure in the market, organizations are particularly interested in optimizing their processes. Process mining enables the extraction of valuable knowledge from event logs, such as deviations, bottlenecks, and anomalies. Due to the increase of process complexity in flexible environments, visual exploration is increasingly becoming more challenging. In this paper, we propose ProcessExplorer, an interactive process mining approach to enable fast data analysis and exploration. ProcessExplorer takes an event log as input to automatically suggest subsets of similar process behavior, evaluate each subset, generate interesting insights, and suggest the subsets with the most interesting characteristics. We implemented our approach into an interactive visual exploration system, which we use as part of a user study conducted to evaluate our approach. Our results show that ProcessExplorer can be successfully applied to analyze and explore real-life data sets efficiently.}

        abstract = {Learning a musical instrument requires a lot of practice, which ideally, should be done every day. During practice sessions, students are on their own in the overwhelming majority of the time, but access to experts that support students "just-in-time" is limited. Therefore, students commonly do not receive any feedback during their practice sessions. Adequate feedback, especially for beginners, is highly important for three particular reasons: (1) preventing the acquirement of wrong motions, (2) avoiding frustration due to a steep learning curve, and (3) potential health problems that arise from straining muscles or joints harmfully. In this paper, we envision the usage of head-mounted displays as assistance modality to support musical instrument learning. We propose a modular concept for several assistance modes to help students during their practice sessions. Finally, we discuss hardware requirements and implementations to realize the proposed concepts.},

        abstract = {To better support emerging interactive mobile applications such as those VR-/AR-based, cloud computing is quickly evolving into a new computing paradigm called edge computing. Edge computing has the promise to bring cloud resources to the network edge to augment the capability of mobile devices in close proximity to the user. One big challenge in edge computing is the efficient allocation and adaptation of edge resources in the presence of high dynamics imposed by user mobility. This paper provides a formal study of this problem. By characterizing a variety of static and dynamic performance measures with a comprehensive cost model, we formulate the online edge resource allocation problem with a mixed nonlinear optimization problem. We propose MOERA, a mobility-agnostic online algorithm based on the "regularization" technique, which can be used to decompose the problem into separate subproblems with regularized objective functions and solve them using convex programming. Through rigorous analysis we are able to prove that MOERA can guarantee a parameterized competitive ratio, without requiring any a priori knowledge on input. We carry out extensive experiments with various real-world data and show that MOERA can achieve an empirical competitive ratio of less than 1.2, reduces the total cost by 4x compared to static approaches, and outperforms the online greedy one-shot solution by 70\%. Moreover, we verify that even being future-agnostic, MOERA can achieve comparable performance to approaches with perfect partial future knowledge. We also discuss practical issues with respect to the implementation of our algorithm in real edge computing systems.}

        abstract = {Today's readily available security measures to defend one's computers against malicious USB devices either show popups that require the user to allow each interaction, or they use identity-based peripheral devices attachment rules to allow or deny interaction with the new USB device, which again involves the user. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for defending against USB attacks with the main goal of not involving the user.For making the security relevant decision, we take both context of the user's session and provenance of the security relevant event into account. That is, we assume that the user cannot plug a device into their machine when they are not present, e.g. when they have left their computer. We infer that the state of the lock screen relates to the presence of the user and do not allow new USB devices when the screen is locked. Further, we deflect traditional BadUSB attacks by taking the provenance of dangerous keystrokes into account when making an automated security decision. We extend the same idea to other security relevant contexts, such as network re-configuration.To substantiate our claims, we identify two classes of USB-borne attacks: driver exploitation and user emulation. While the first exploits could and can be prevented with secure coding and runtime mitigations, the second does not circumvent bugs in code but rather masquerades a device as another. We also investigate real-world usage of USB and present data which shows that we can expect users to have a single keyboard. Consequently, we increase protection against said masquerading attacks by filtering keys deemed dangerous or preventing security relevant actions if the keystroke originated from a newly attached USB device. We present an implementation of our filter for both GNU/Linux and Microsoft Windows.},

Therefore, this transition requires a transformation of the system?s structure and control mechanisms to meet the requirements for future SGs. However, it is important to examine and thoroughly test those novel approaches to enable a safe and smooth system change. These tests need to be conducted in a safe environment due to the potential of causing system failures, which may result in monetary losses and ultimately threaten human lives. Modeling and simulation is an established technique for testing and evaluating critical systems in a safe environment. In this context, the paper aims at providing an overview of current modeling and simulation tools related to future SGs, by presenting them alongside corresponding challenges for the simulation of ICT, electrical grids and combined cyber-physical approaches.},

Often process discovery is the first step in their analytical workflow. However, when working with large amount of data and complex processes, exploring as-is process models to obtain interesting and insightful knowledge can be challenging. We propose ProcessExplorer, an interactive visual recommendation system for process discovery to ease event log exploration. ProcessExplorer automatically analyzes the event log to obtain promising subsets of cases, evaluates interesting process performance indicators, and recommends those that are most interesting and insightful. Our system uses multi-perspective trace clustering to identify candidate cases of interest and a deviation-based approach to assess the interestingness of process performance indicators. We implemented ProcessExplorer as a standalone desktop application that allows to explore any process and any event log. Our demo shows how the workflow of analysts is supported by the system through suggesting subset and insights recommendations.},

        abstract = {Signage is transitioning from static analogue signs towards Digital Signage (DS), which introduces a variety of benefits. Among those are remote-maintenance, supporting dynamic content like videos and animations, and the simplification of updating content. However, DS solutions, despite being ubiquitous, are often tailored to specific use-cases, which limits their re-usability and updateability in case of severe changes to their environment. For instance, digital door signs for office spaces may become unusable if the office space is reorganized as storage or seminar rooms. Coping with such changes may result in additional costs since new DS solutions need to be purchased or in-depth changes to the software of the currently deployed DS solution are required. To address these problems we propose the Modularly Operated Digital Signage (MODS) framework, facilitating the dynamic changing of DS functionality in a modular fashion. We present the frameworks modular concept and describe its individual components. Subsequently, we briefly elaborate on the properties of the currently implemented modules. Additionally, we discuss the conducted pre-study to receive a first indicator for the usability of the framework.},

Advanced monitoring and control mechanisms are necessary to deal with the identification of appliances. In this paper, a model for their automatic identification is proposed. It is based on a set of 19 features that are extracted by analyzing energy consumption, time usage and location from a set of device profiles. Then, machine learning approaches are employed by experimenting different classifiers based on such model for the identification of appliances and, finally, an analysis on the feature importance is provided.},

Through two controlled experiments with a total of 36 participants, we first explore direct interaction with interfaces that are displayed on the floor and require the user to look down to interact. Secondly, we investigate indirect interaction with interfaces that, although operated by the user's feet, are always visible as they are floating in front of the user. Based on the results of the two experiments, we provide design recommendations for direct and indirect foot-based user interfaces.},

        abstract = {Mobile edge computing is gaining traction due to its ability to deliver ultra-low-latency services for mobile applications. This is achieved through a federation of edge clouds in close proximity of users. However, the intrinsic mobility of users brings a high level of dynamics to the edge environment, calling for sophisticated service migration management across the edge clouds. Previous solutions for edge service placement/migration are architecture-specific, centralized, or are based on restricted cost models. These limitations leave doubts about the practicality of these approaches due to the lack of a standardized reference model for edge clouds. In this paper, we propose a general framework for optimizing edge service migration based on reinforcement learning techniques. Using our framework, edge service migration strategies can be learned with respect to a large variety of optimization goals. Moreover, our learning-based algorithm is agnostic to the underlying architecture and resource constraints. Preliminary results show that our model-free learning-based approach can compete with model-based baselines and adapt to different objectives.},

        abstract = {Over the years, the wide-spread usage of smartphones leads to large amounts of personal data being stored by them. These data, in turn, can be accessed by the apps installed on the smartphones, and potentially misused, jeopardizing the privacy of smartphone users. While the app stores provide indicators that allow an estimation of the privacy risks of individual apps, these indicators have repeatedly been shown as too confusing for the lay users without technical expertise. We have developed an information flyer with the goal of providing decision support for these users and enabling them make more informed decisions regarding their privacy upon choosing and installing smartphone apps. Our flyer is based on previous research in mental models of smartphone privacy and security and includes heuristics for choosing privacy-friendlier apps used by IT-security experts. It also addresses common misconceptions of users regarding smartphones. The flyer was evaluated in a user study. The results of the study show, that the users who read the flyer tend to take privacy-relevant factors into account by relying on the heuristics in the flyer more often. Hence, the flyer succeeds in supporting users in making more informed privacy-related decisions.}

        abstract = {In the communication system domain, constructing and maintaining network topologies via topology control algorithms is an important crosscutting research area. Network topologies are usually modeled using attributed graphs whose nodes and edges represent the network nodes and their interconnecting links. A key requirement of topology control algorithms is to fulfill certain consistency and optimization properties to ensure a high quality of service. Still, few attempts have been made to constructively integrate these properties into the development process of topology control algorithms. Furthermore, even though many topology control algorithms share substantial parts (such as structural patterns or tie-breaking strategies), few works constructively leverage these commonalities and differences of topology control algorithms systematically. In previous work, we addressed the constructive integration of consistency properties into the development process. We outlined a constructive, model-driven methodology for designing individual topology control algorithms. Valid and high-quality topologies are characterized using declarative graph constraints; topology control algorithms are specified using programmed graph transformation. We applied a well-known static analysis technique to refine a given topology control algorithm in a way that the resulting algorithm preserves the specified graph constraints. In this paper, we extend our constructive methodology by generalizing it to support the specification of families of topology control algorithms. To show the feasibility of our approach, we reengineering six existing topology control algorithms and develop e-kTC, a novel energy-efficient variant of the topology control algorithm kTC. Finally, we evaluate a subset of the specified topology control algorithms using a new tool integration of the graph transformation tool eMoflon and the Simonstrator network simulation framework.},

        abstract = {The impact of computer networks on modern society cannot be estimated. Arguably, computer networks are one of the core enablers of the contemporary world. Large computer networks are essential tools which drive our economy, critical infrastructure, education and entertainment. Due to their ubiquitousness and importance, it is reasonable to assume that security is an intrinsic aspect of their design. Yet, due to how networks developed, the security of this communication medium is still an outstanding issue.  Proactive and reactive security mechanisms exist to cope with the security problems that arise when computer networks are used. Proactive mechanisms attempt to prevent malicious activity in a network. Prevention alone, however, is not sufficient: it is imprudent to assume that security cannot be bypassed. Reactive mechanisms are responsible for finding malicious activity that circumvents proactive security mechanisms. The most emblematic reactive mechanism for detecting intrusions in a network is known as a Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS).  Large networks represent immense attack surfaces where malicious actors can conceal their intentions by distributing their activities. A single NIDS needs to process massive quantities of traffic to discover malicious distributed activities. As individual NIDS have limited resources and a narrow monitoring scope, large networks need to employ multiple NIDS. Coordinating the detection efforts of NIDS is not a trivial task and, as a result, Collaborative Intrusion Detection System (CIDSs) were conceived. A CIDS is a group of  NIDSs that collaborate to exchange information that enables them to detect distributed malicious activities. CIDSs may coordinate NIDSs using different communication overlays.  From among the different communication overlays a CIDSs may use, a distributed one promises the most. Distributed overlays are scalable, dynamic, resilient and do not have a single point of failure. Distributed CIDSs, i.e., those using distributed overlays, are preferred in theory, yet not often deployed in practice. Several open issues exist that constraint the use of CIDSs in practice.  In this thesis, we propose solutions to address some of the outstanding issues that prevent distributed CIDSs from becoming viable in practice. Our contributions rely on diverse Machine Learning (ML) techniques and concepts to solve these issues. The thesis is structured around five main contributions, each developed within a dedicated chapter. Our specific contributions are as follows.  Dataset Generation  We survey the intrusion detection research field to analyze and categorize the datasets that are used to develop, compare, and test NIDSs as well as CIDSs. From the defects we found in the datasets, we develop a classification of dataset defects. With our classification of dataset issues, we develop concepts to create suitable datasets for training and testing ML based NIDSs and CIDSs. With our concepts, we injects synthetic attacks into real background traffic. The generated attacks replicate the properties of the background traffic to make attacks as indistinguishable as they can be from real traffic.  Intrusion Detection  We develop an anomaly-based NIDS capable of overcoming some of the limitations that NIDSs have when they are used in large networks. Our anomaly-based NIDS leverages autoencoders and dropout to create models of normality that accurately describe the behavior of large networks. Our NIDS scales to the number of analyzed features, can learn adequate normality models even when anomalies are present in the learning data, operates in real time, and is accurate with only minimal false positives.  Community Formation  We formulate concepts to build communities of NIDSs, coined community-based CIDSs, that implement centralized ML algorithms in a distributed environment. Community-based CIDSs detect distributed attacks through the use of ensemble learning. Ensemble learning is used to combine local ML models created by different communities to detect network-wide attacks that individual communities would otherwise struggle to detect.  Information Dissemination  We design a dissemination strategy specific to CIDSs. The strategy enables NIDSs to efficiently disseminate information to discover and infer when similar network events take place, potentially uncovering distributed attacks. In contrast to other dissemination strategies, our strategy efficiently encodes, aggregates, correlates, and shares network features while minimizing network overhead. We use Sketches to aggregate data and Bayesian Networks to deduce new information from the aggregation process.  Collusion Detection  We devise an evidence-based trust mechanism that detects if the NIDSs of a CIDS are acting honestly, according to the goals of the CIDS, or dishonestly. The trust mechanism uses the reliability of the sensors and Bayesian-like estimators to compute trust scores. From the trust scores, our mechanism is designed to detect not only single dishonest NIDSs but multiple coalitions of dishonest ones. A coalition is a coordinated group of dishonest NIDSs that lie to boost their trust scores, and to reduce the trust scores of others outside the group.}

        abstract = {Speaker recognition is applied in smart home devices, interactive voice response systems, call centers, online banking and payment solutions as well as in forensic scenarios. This dissertation is concerned with speaker recognition systems in unconstrained environments. Before this dissertation, research on making better decisions in unconstrained environments was insufficient. Aside from decision making, unconstrained environments imply two other subjects: security and privacy. Within the scope of this dissertation, these research subjects are regarded as both security against short-term replay attacks and privacy preservation within state-of-the-art biometric voice comparators in the light of a potential leak of biometric data. The aforementioned research subjects are united in this dissertation to sustain good decision making processes facing uncertainty from varying signal quality and to strengthen security as well as preserve privacy.      Conventionally, biometric comparators are trained to classify between mated and non-mated reference,--,probe pairs under idealistic conditions but are expected to operate well in the real world. However, the more the voice signal quality degrades, the more erroneous decisions are made. The severity of their impact depends on the requirements of a biometric application. In this dissertation, quality estimates are proposed and employed for the purpose of making better decisions on average in a formalized way (quantitative method), while the specifications of decision requirements of a biometric application remain unknown. By using the Bayesian decision framework, the specification of application-depending decision requirements is formalized, outlining operating points: the decision thresholds. The assessed quality conditions combine ambient and biometric noise, both of which occurring in commercial as well as in forensic application scenarios. Dual-use (civil and governmental) technology is investigated. As it seems unfeasible to train systems for every possible signal degradation, a low amount of quality conditions is used. After examining the impact of degrading signal quality on biometric feature extraction, the extraction is assumed ideal in order to conduct a fair benchmark. This dissertation proposes and investigates methods for propagating information about quality to decision making. By employing quality estimates, a biometric system's output (comparison scores) is normalized in order to ensure that each score encodes the least-favorable decision trade-off in its value. Application development is segregated from requirement specification. Furthermore, class discrimination and score calibration performance is improved over all decision requirements for real world applications.  In contrast to the ISOIEC 19795-1:2006 standard on biometric performance (error rates), this dissertation is based on biometric inference for probabilistic decision making (subject to prior probabilities and cost terms). This dissertation elaborates on the paradigm shift from requirements by error rates to requirements by beliefs in priors and costs. Binary decision error trade-off plots are proposed, interrelating error rates with prior and cost beliefs, i.e., formalized decision requirements. Verbal tags are introduced to summarize categories of least-favorable decisions: the plot's canvas follows from Bayesian decision theory. Empirical error rates are plotted, encoding categories of decision trade-offs by line styles. Performance is visualized in the latent decision subspace for evaluating empirical performance regarding changes in prior and cost based decision requirements.  Security against short-term audio replay attacks (a collage of sound units such as phonemes and syllables) is strengthened. The unit-selection attack is posed by the ASVspoof 2015 challenge (English speech data), representing the most difficult to detect voice presentation attack of this challenge. In this dissertation, unit-selection attacks are created for German speech data, where support vector machine and Gaussian mixture model classifiers are trained to detect collage edges in speech representations based on wavelet and Fourier analyses. Competitive results are reached compared to the challenged submissions.   Homomorphic encryption is proposed to preserve the privacy of biometric information in the case of database leakage. In this dissertation, log-likelihood ratio scores, representing biometric evidence objectively, are computed in the latent biometric subspace. Conventional comparators rely on the feature extraction to ideally represent biometric information, latent subspace comparators are trained to find ideal representations of the biometric information in voice reference and probe samples to be compared. Two protocols are proposed for the the two-covariance comparison model, a special case of probabilistic linear discriminant analysis. Log-likelihood ratio scores are computed in the encrypted domain based on encrypted representations of the biometric reference and probe. As a consequence, the biometric information conveyed in voice samples is, in contrast to many existing protection schemes, stored protected and without information loss. The first protocol preserves privacy of end-users, requiring one public/private key pair per biometric application. The latter protocol preserves privacy of end-users and comparator vendors with two key pairs. Comparators estimate the biometric evidence in the latent subspace, such that the subspace model requires data protection as well. In both protocols, log-likelihood ratio based decision making meets the requirements of the ISOIEC 24745:2011 biometric information protection standard in terms of unlinkability, irreversibility, and renewability properties of the protected voice data.},

           title = {Interaction Concepts for Knowledge Work on Augmented Desktops},
          school = {Technische Universit{\"a}t Darmstadt},
          author = {Jan Riemann},
        abstract = {With the proliferation of computers in today's workplaces, work processes have changed: Especially in the field of knowledge work, which heavily relies on the use of information sources, electronic documents have become commonplace. However, despite the advantages of digital systems, like global access to information or advanced search facilities, physical media have not yet vanished. The amount of paper used is even still increasing. Even digitally available documents are often printed in order to leverage the unique affordances of printed paper (e.g., its flexibility, low weight, etc.). Another particular advantage of physical media on physical desks is their aptitude to support the spatial layout of sets of documents (e.g., piling or spreading them out or assigning categories to them through their spatial position, e.g., by placing them in the storage area vs. working area, or even more specialized areas on the desk for categories like "to be read" or "urgent"). As a result, most work processes do not only require the use of either digital or physical documents but the concurrent use of both types. We use the term "hybrid" to denote this concurrent use.   As of today, there is still only quite limited support for work practices that encompass digital and physical documents concurrently. According to common practice at stationary workplaces, digital documents are stored on a computer and viewed on a monitor in front of the user, while physical documents are placed on a desk, leading to a strict separation of digital and physical documents.  For several years, so-called digital tabletops have been available: desks with a large flat display acting as the desk surface, supplemented with touch-sensing capabilities. In principle, it is now possible for digital and physical documents to coexist on the table surface, laying the foundation for more sophisticated working practices. However, more than a decade since the advent of tabletops, the integration of digital and physical knowledge work still leaves a lot to be desired. Where digital tabletops are used today, their surface is always kept entirely clean of physical objects so as not to obstruct any of the interactive display surface. Since this is a quite alien use pattern for desks, tabletops have not yet gained a reasonable market share.  The primary goal of this thesis is to foster tighter integration between the digital and physical worlds. To do so, it first contributes the PeriTop concept, a two-class display concept that leverages the surfaces of objects as a secondary peripheral display in addition to the primary tabletop display. PeriTop serves as a basis for several further contributions presented in this thesis. All further contributions together are categorized into three main areas, namely, stationary hybrid knowledge work, layout for hybrid environments, and mobile workspaces.  In the first area, stationary hybrid knowledge work, this thesis contributes (1) ProjecTop, a novel concept for leveraging the surface of occluding objects to resolve occlusion "in situ" without the need for using additional display space on the tabletop, and (2) the StackTop concept for hybrid stacking, which allows arbitrary interweaving of digital and physical documents in a coherent stack.  In the second area, layout for hybrid environments, this thesis contributes (1) FreeTop, a flexible approach for assessing projection quality on surfaces in order to facilitate projection-based augmentation of physical objects, and (2) the FlowPut concept, an environment-aware layout system for interactive tangibles based on FreeTop.  In the third area, mobile workspaces, the aspect of mobile work in the context of hybrid work environments is tackled by contributing PiraTop, a concept for augmented reality (AR)-based remote access to stationary hybrid workspaces. It leverages the idea of spatial memory to facilitate access.  The final contribution of this thesis is the OverTop concept. OverTop combines the advantage of AR and the knowledge gained with PiraTop with the contributions on stationary desks, particularly PeriTop. Therefore, it considers head-mounted augmented reality displays as an addition to stationary tabletops, making the space above the desk surface and above the objects that populate the desk available for hybrid knowledge work.  The thesis concludes with a summary and an outlook on future work directions.},

        abstract = {The progressing digitalization increases the demand for interactive devices that bridge the physical and digital world. While there is great potential for customized interactive devices tailored to specific applications or users, until recently, integrating interactivity in custom devices required pre-defined components (e.g., rectangular buttons or flat touchscreens) that constrains the shape of the device. A more flexible alternative has opened up with the advent of 3D printing which empowers companies, developers, and end users to design and fabricate custom-shaped individual objects on demand with relatively low effort. Even though recognized as revolutionizing the manufacturing process, the 3D printing of custom-made interactive devices still requires novel sensor concepts, that operate on complex geometries, and significant design or assembly effort.  This thesis concerns the 3D printing of interactive input devices that respond to a variety of external stimuli and are printed in a single pass without requiring significant assembly steps. It consists of the following five major contributions: The first contribution is a fabrication pipeline to design and 3D print custom-shaped touch sensors on complex 3D objects. Then, the second contribution extends the first pipeline to detect hovering, touching, or pressing of a finger on a 3D-printed object. The third contribution continues to explore deformation-aware 3D-printed objects that detect pressure, squeeze, and bending in combination with a capacitive touchscreen. The fourth contribution adds liquid to 3D-printed objects to detect tilting and motion interactions. Based on these liquid-filled objects,  the fifth contribution is an alternative sensing approach that does not require powered electronics during the interaction. Instead, each sensor concept memorizes the effect of a pre-defined external stimulus by changes in its internal structure. These changes can be read-out at a later time through a capacitive touchscreen. A series of evaluations and applications show the feasibility and broad applicability of all contributions for 3D printing of custom-made interactive devices.}

As this either scares the user in VR or breaks the user's immersion, research has yet to find a way to seamlessly represent physical passersby in virtual worlds. In this paper, we propose and evaluate three different ways to represent physical passersby in a Virtual Environment using Augmented Virtuality. The representations encompass showing a Pointcloud, showing a 3D-Model, and showing an Image Overlay of the passerby. Our results show that while an Image Overlay and a 3D-Model are the fastest representations to spot passersby, the 3D-Model and the Pointcloud representations were the most accurate.},

        abstract = {The destructive effects of cyber-attacks demand more proactive security approaches. One such promising approach is the idea of Collaborative Intrusion Detection Systems (CIDSs). These systems combine the knowledge of multiple sensors (e.g., intrusion detection systems, honeypots or firewalls) to create a holistic picture of a monitored network. Sensors monitor parts of a network and exchange alert data to learn from each other, improve their detection capabilities and ultimately identify sophisticated attacks. Nevertheless, if one or a group of sensors is unreliable (due to incompetence or malice), the system might miss important information needed to detect attacks. In this article, we propose Sphinx, an evidence-based trust mechanism capable of detecting unreliable sensors within a CIDS. Sphinx detects, both, single sensors or coalitions of dishonest sensors that lie about the reliability of others to boost or worsen their trust score. Our evaluation shows that, given an honest majority of sensors, dishonesty is punished in a timely manner. Moreover, if several coalitions exist, even when more than 50\% of all sensors are dishonest, dishonesty is punished.}

Here, much attention is given to smart cameras, the Internet of Things and the Internet in general, while sonic AR systems are overlooked. Many users, for example, blindfold their laptop cameras with physical layers, but it seems as if no attention is drawn to the sonic hardware that can be hacked just like cameras. In this position paper, we highlight everyday situations that are prone to cause privacy problems through Sonic AR. We then look at current proposals to protect users from camera-caused privacy violations as examples and discuss how they could be adopted to prevent sonic information misuse. We conclude by stating that the current privacy discussion overlooks Sonic AR, although this is a channel across which even more detailed and hence, more sensitive, information can be communicated and misused.},

        abstract = {Many-to-many communication is a central component of widespread technologies like social networks and the IoT. For many applications, it is desirable that the anonymity of communication participants is preserved. We focus on the protection of sender anonymity in peer-to-peer networks that allow scalable group communication via publish-subscribe overlays. While DC-nets can be used for achieving sender and receiver anonymity for many-to-many communication, they also induce a considerable communication and computation overhead. We address this challenge by introducing a modified version of DC-nets that induces less overhead than classical DC-nets while preserving their sender anonymity properties. Moreover, we present challenges that arise when combining publish-subscribe overlays with DC-nets. We introduce a novel technique that addresses the presented challenges, hereby protecting the anonymity of senders during its initialization and runtime. As our approach allows for anonymization groups of configurable size, we also analyze how groups that are suitable for this purpose can be formed.}

To servetheir purpose, passwords require a certain degree of com-plexity which is often enforced through password policies.This results in complicated passwords, which might not onlybe hard for users to create, but also hard to remember. Fur-thermore, users might reuse passwords which they feelare secure. We present a scheme for deterministic pass-word generation that solves these problems by assisting theuser in generating and remembering passwords. The pass-words are generated based on previously stored meta data(e.g., policies) and a master password. Since the passwordgeneration is deterministic, only the master password is required to recreate the passwords. As proof of concept weimplemented a mobile app and pre-evaluated it. The pre-evaluation indicates that our scheme offers a good usability.},

            note = {The Subject-oriented Process Management (S-PM) enables a clearly visual modeling of concurrent systems, especially of technical processes and business processes (there: Subject-oriented Business Process Management, S-BPM) [1].  In order to reach a common understanding of the S-PM language features used during process modeling, validation and execution a precise execution semantic is needed. Such an execution semantic can be specified with the formalism of Abstract State Machines (ASM) [2] and executed with the CoreASM framework [3]. An executable specification of the S-PM language features allows an abstract execution of process models and therefore a mutual validation between the execution semantic and the process models.  Existing works related to the Subject-oriented Business Process Management are either not based on a formal specification [4, 5, 6, 7, 8], are purely theoretical works without implementation [9, 10, 11, 12, 13] or cover only a limited scope of language features [14].  This work continues existing approaches for a formal specification of the Subject-oriented Business Process Management in order to reach an executable ASM specification with a complete language scope.  Therefore a structural model was developed that combines existing S-PM language features with additionaly required features. The specifications of language features from previous works have been transferred to CoreASM, adapted to the structural model and extended with the additional language features. The specification of the execution engine has been extended to allow an abstract execution of process models. For an interactive process validation a console application, that controls the abstract execution, has been developed and connected to the CoreASM framework.  Analogical to software testing techniques the correctness of the developed specification has been ensured through unit, integration and system tests, which also yield the proof of implementation. The unit tests ensure the correct execution of single specification sections whereas the integration tests ensure a complete process execution sequence to test specific features defined by crafted process models. For the system tests practical proven process models of the S-BPM community were used along technical process models from the PolyEnergyNet project [15], which were chosen as their extend and complexity were especially useful for a comprehensive proof of implementation. The abstract execution of those processes with the console application was used for the system tests and enabled a process validation.},

        abstract = {Das Subjektorientierte Prozessmanagement (Subject-oriented Process Management, S-PM) erm{\"o}glicht eine {\"u}bersichtliche graphische Modellierung von nebenl{\"a}ufigen Systemen, insbesondere von technischen Prozessen und von Gesch{\"a}ftsprozessen (dort: Subject-oriented Business Process Management, S-BPM) [1]. Damit bei der Prozessmodellierung, -validierung bis hin zur -ausf{\"u}hrung ein gemeinsames Verst{\"a}ndnis {\"u}ber die Bedeutung der verwendeten S-PM Sprachelemente besteht wird eine eindeutige Ausf{\"u}hrungssemantik ben{\"o}tigt. Eine solche Ausf{\"u}hrungssemantik kann mit dem Formalismus der Abstrakten Zustandsmaschinen (Abstract State Machines, ASM) [2] spezifiziert und mit dem CoreASM Framework [3] ausgef{\"u}hrt werden. Eine ausf{\"u}hrbare Spezifikation der S-PM Sprachelemente erm{\"o}glicht eine abstrakte Ausf{\"u}hrung von Prozessmodellen und damit eine wechselseitige Validierung der Ausf{\"u}hrungssemantik und der Prozessmodelle.  Bestehende Arbeiten zum Subjektorientierten Prozessmanagement basieren entweder nicht auf einer formalen Spezifikation [4, 5, 6, 7, 8], sind rein theoretische Arbeiten ohne Implementierung [9, 10, 11, 12, 13] oder bilden nur einen begrenzten Sprachumfang ab [14].  In dieser Arbeit wurden bestehende Ans{\"a}tze zur formalen Spezifikation vom Subjektorientierten Prozessmanagement mit dem Ziel weiterentwickelt, eine ausf{\"u}hrbare ASM Spezifikation mit vollem Sprachumfang zu erhalten. Dazu wurde ein Strukturmodell aus vorhandenen S-PM Sprachelementen entwickelt und um zus{\"a}tzliche ben{\"o}tigte Sprachelemente erweitert. Die Spezifikationen von Sprachelementen aus bestehenden Arbeiten wurden nach CoreASM {\"u}bertragen, an das Strukturmodell angepasst und um die weiteren Sprachelemente erg{\"a}nzt. Dabei wurde die Spezifikation der Ausf{\"u}hrungseinheit so erweitert, dass eine abstrakte Ausf{\"u}hrung von Prozessmodellen erm{\"o}glicht wurde. Zur interaktiven Prozessvalidierung wurde eine Konsolenanwendung entwickelt, die mit dem CoreASM Framework verbunden ist und die abstrakte Ausf{\"u}hrung steuern kann. Analog zu Testverfahren der Softwareentwicklung konnte durch Komponenten-, Integrations- und Systemtests die Fehlerfreiheit der erarbeiteten Spezifikation sichergestellt und damit der Machbarkeitsnachweis erbracht werden. Durch Komponententests wurde dabei die korrekte Ausf{\"u}hrung einzelner Spezifikationsabschnitte kontrolliert und mit Integrationstests wurde der Ablauf in Testprozessen derart vorgeben, dass gezielt die Einhaltung gew{\"u}nschter Merkmale auf Erf{\"u}llung getestet wurde. F{\"u}r die Systemtests wurde neben praktisch erprobten Prozessmodellen der S-BPM Community auf Prozessmodelle des PolyEnergyNet Forschungsprojekts [15] zur{\"u}ckgegriffen, da diese technischen Modelle wegen ihres hohen Umfangs und hoher Komplexit{\"a}t f{\"u}r einen umfassenden Machbarkeitsnachweis besonders geeignet waren. Durch die Nutzung der Konsolenanwendung konnten diese Prozesse durch eine abstrakte Ausf{\"u}hrung validiert und dadurch gleichzeitig die Systemtests durchgef{\"u}hrt werden.}

        abstract = {The effects of botnet attacks, over the years, have been devastating. From high volume Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks to ransomware attacks, it is evident that defensive measures need to be taken. Indeed, there has been a number of successful takedowns of botnets that exhibit a centralized architecture. However, this is not the case with distributed botnets that are more resilient and armed with countermeasures against monitoring. In this paper, we argue that monitoring countermeasures, applied by botmasters, will only become more sophisticated; to such an extent that monitoring, under these adverse conditions, may become infeasible. That said, we present the most detailed analysis, to date, of parameters that influence a P2P botnet's resilience and monitoring resistance. Integral to our analysis, we introduce BotChurn (BC) a realistic and botnet-focused churn generator that can assist in the analysis of botnets. Our experimental results suggest that certain parameter combinations greatly limit intelligence gathering operations. Furthermore, our analysis highlights the need for extensive collaboration between defenders. For instance, we show that even the combined knowledge of 500 monitoring instances is insufficient to fully enumerate some of the examined botnets. In this context, we also raise the question of whether botnet monitoring will still be feasible in the near future.}

With the increase of complexity and flexibility of processes, it is getting more and more challenging for discovery algorithms to generate accurate and comprehensive models. Trace clustering aims to overcome this issue by splitting event logs into smaller behavioral similar sub-logs. From these sub-logs more accurate and comprehensive process models can be reconstructed. In this paper, we propose a novel clustering approach that uses frequent itemset mining on the case attributes to also reveal relationships on the data perspective. Our approach includes this additional knowledge as well as optimizes the fitness of the underlying process models of each cluster to generate accurate clustering results. We compare our method with six other clustering methods and evaluate our approach using synthetic and real-life event logs.},

As a consequence it is particularly challenging to locate possible process issues or potential optimizations using process mining. Process mining aims at analyzing the actual usage of information systems by reconstructing a process model from recorded event log. However, such large amount of data often leads to spaghetti-like visualizations which are in-comprehensive and inaccurate. This paper addresses this issue by introducing an unsupervised visual recommender system for process analysis. The system provides suggestions during the interactive visual inspection of the discovered process model by recommending points of interests (e.g., long duration times or exceptional process behavior) ranked by severity. For calculated interest points we characterize the deviation from the average behavior as well as compute the effect the observed conspicuousness has. Our approach has been implemented as a ProM plugin. We evaluate our approach by presenting a case study using a real life event log.}

BINet has been designed to handle both the control flow and the data perspective of a business process. Additionally, we propose a heuristic for setting the threshold of an anomaly detection algorithm automatically. We demonstrate that BINet can be used to detect anomalies in event logs not only on a case level, but also on event attribute level. We compare BINet to 6 other state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms and evaluate their performance on an elaborate data corpus of 60 synthetic and 21 real life event logs using artificial anomalies. BINet reached an average F{$_1$} score over all detection levels of 0.83, whereas the next best approach, a denoising autoencoder, reached only 0.74. This F{$_1$} score is calculated over two different levels of detection, namely case and attribute level. BINet reached 0.84 on case and 0.82 on attribute level, whereas the next best approach reached 0.78 and 0.71 respectively.}

For this purpose, such data sets are often visualized as large graphs, depicting information and interrelations as interconnected vertices. A visual representation of such large graphs (for example, social networks, collaboration analyses or biological data sets) has to find a trade-off between showing details in a magnified{--}or zoomed-in{--}view and the overall graph structure. Showing these two aspects at the same time results in a visual overload that is largely inaccessible to human users. In this article, we augment previous work and present a new approach to address this overload by combining and extending graph-theoretic properties with community detection algorithms. Our non-destructive approach to reducing visual complexity while retaining core properties of the given graph is user-guided and semi-automated. The results yielded by applying our approach to large real-world network data sets reveal a massive reduction of displayed vertices and connections while keeping essential graph structures intact.},

For interacting with these environments, traditionally 2D input and output elements are being used. However, recently interaction spaces also expanded to 3D space, which enabled new possibilities but also led to challenges in assisting users with interacting in such a 3D space. Usually, this challenge of communicating 3D positions is solved visually. This paper explores a different approach: spatial guidance through vibrotactile instructions. Therefore, we introduce TactileGlove, a smart glove equipped with vibrotactile actuators for providing spatial guidance in 3D space. We contribute a user study with 15 participants to explore how a different number of actuators and metaphors affect the user performance. As a result, we found that using a Pull metaphor for vibrotactile navigation instructions is preferred by our participants. Further, we found that using a higher number of actuators reduces the target acquisition time than when using a low number.},

Video conferencing and similar online applications create great benefits bringing people who physically cannot spend as much time as they want virtually together. However, such remote experiences can also tend to lose the feeling of traditional experiences. People lack direct visual presence and no haptic feedback is available. In this paper, we tackle this problem by introducing our system called CheckMate. We combine Augmented Reality and capacitive 3D printed objects that can be sensed on an interactive surface to enable remote interaction while providing the same tangible experience as in co-located scenarios. As a proof-of-concept, we implemented a sample application based on the traditional chess game.},

        abstract = {Embedding sensors into objects allow them to recognize various interactions.However, sensing usually requires active electronics that are often costly, need time to be assembled, and constantly draw power. Thus, we propose off-line sensing: passive 3D-printed sensors that detect one-time interactions, such as accelerating or flipping, but neither require active electronics nor power at the time of the interaction. They memorize a pre-defined interaction via an embedded structure filled with a conductive medium (e.g., a liquid). Whether a sensor was exposed to the interaction can be read-out via a capacitive touchscreen. Sensors are printed in a single pass on a consumer-level 3D printer. Through a series of experiments, we show the feasibility of off-line sensing.},

This paper presents a new approach for the model-driven specification, simulation-based evaluation, and implementation of possible mappings that respect a set of given constraints and using linear optimization solving techniques to select one optimal mapping. It will be shown that specifying algorithms for the virtual network embedding problem is possible by using a high abstraction level and that the search space to solve the problem can be significantly reduced by defining attribute or structural constraints.}

Consequently, it is more necessary than ever to choose software configurations that minimize systems' exposure surface to these threats. In order to support users in assessing the security risks induced by their software configurations and in making informed decisions, we introduce M-STAR, a Modular Software Trustworthiness ARchitecture and framework for probabilistically assessing the trustworthiness of software systems, based on evidence, such as their vulnerability history and source code properties. Integral to M-STAR is a software trustworthiness model, consistent with the concept of computational trust. Computational trust models are rooted in Bayesian probability and Dempster-Shafer Belief theory, offering mathematical soundness and expressiveness to our framework. To evaluate our framework, we instantiate M-STAR for Debian Linux packages, and investigate real-world deployment scenarios. In our experiments with real-world data, M-STAR could assess the relative trustworthiness of complete software configurations with an error of less than 10\%. Due to its modular design, our proposed framework is agile, as it can incorporate future advances in the field of code analysis and vulnerability prediction. Our results point out that M-STAR can be a valuable tool for system administrators, regular users and developers, helping them assess and manage risks associated with their software configurations.},

        abstract = {This dissertation addresses the important challenge of efficiency in anonymous communication. Solving this challenge is essential to provide anonymity in group communication.  Every exchanged message leaks metadata: this information describes the communication itself with, among others, sender, recipients, frequency of the communication. While the law protects this information, it is often published and misused with consequences for the participants of the communication{--}often consequences particular for the senders of information.  Anonymous communication systems like Tor break the link between senders and recipients of messages and diminish emerging metadata. However, their design requires duplicating messages for all recipients early, mostly at the sender itself. With that, the system has to handle an unnecessary burden of processing identical messages. This dissertation contributes a novel mechanism that establishes communication groups such that the message duplication is pushed as close to the recipients as possible. This dissertation also shows that this efficiency improvement does not come at costs of anonymity. Moreover, the group establishment mechanism increases the robustness of the communication against users that leave and join the communication system. To encounter the additional information leakage, different mechanisms to share routing information are introduced and discussed under the angle of efficiency and anonymity. To also protect senders of messages, this dissertation adapts Dining-Cryptographer networks to enable sender anonymity with an adjustable trade-off between efficiency and anonymity.  The scientific contributions of this dissertation fall into the following categories: - Efficient Communication Overlays: A novel overlay establishment mechanism is presented. This mechanism adapts Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to connect senders and recipients with a reduced number of connections while the anonymity remains stable.  - Reliable Communication under Churn: Churn often disrupts communication overlays, this thesis proposes a mechanism to counter this disruptions and increase the robustness of the communication. For that, the ACO-based mechanism utilizes residual pheromones to reconnect subjects to the communication overlay. - Routing Information Exchange considering Efficiency and Anonymity: Four methods to share routing information, namely successor lists, successor lists with multi-layer encryption, Bloom filters, and distributed lookup tables, are introduced into the anonymous communication setting, discussed and evaluated with respect to their properties concerning efficiency and anonymity. - Efficient and Effective Sender Protection: A novel mechanism based on asymmetric dining-cryptographer networks (ADCnets) is proposed to improve the efficiency of sender protection without degrading anonymity over time. Moreover, the trade-off between efficiency and anonymity can be controlled.  Evaluation The developed mechanisms have been extensively evaluated using a combination of simulations and formal arguments. For this evaluation, a graph-based simulation model has been developed enabling to analyze the improvement of the ACO-based communication overlays over conventional overlays. An extensive simulation identified valuable parameter combinations for the ACO mechanism, leading to communication overlays with an efficiency improvement of up to 40\%. This efficiency improvement increases the communication delay only by up to 2 extra hops. The calculation of the achieved anonymity degree indicates no loss of anonymity in comparison to conventional overlays; even more, the anonymity degree does even improve. Under churn, the robustness of the communication also increases by 30\% in comparison to conventional overlays.  The four approaches to routing information exchange are discussed and compared using formal arguments. The evaluation enables to select the appropriate mechanism based on the requirements for memory and communication efficiency and anonymity for the desired application scenario.  The novel adapted ADCnets enable sender anonymity with configurable efficiency and anonymity. As such, they are superior to current approaches implementing cover traffic. A simulation study shows that cover traffic randomization improves efficiency at the cost of anonymity. The proposed ADCnets have been evaluated using formal arguments that demonstrate the efficiency improvement and the preservation of anonymity.  As both efficiency and anonymity are conflicting, they cannot be achieved at the same time; however, the proposed ADCnets enable to balance efficiency and anonymity to the requirements of the application scenario.}

        abstract = {In this talk, we present results on integrating support for variability modeling into a correct-by-construction development methodology for topology control algorithms, as appeared online in the Software \& Systems Modeling journal in 2017. A topology control algorithm reduces the size of the visible neighborhood of a node in a wireless communication network. At the same time, it must fulfill important consistency properties to ensure a high quality of service. In previous work, we proposed a constructive, model-driven methodology for designing individual topology control algorithms based on declarative graph constraints and graph transformation rules; the resulting algorithms are guaranteed to preserve the specified properties. Even though many topology control algorithms share substantial (structural) parts, few works leverage these commonalities at design time. In this work, we generalize our proposed construction methodology by modeling variability points to support the construction of families of algorithms. We show the applicability of our approach by reengineering six existing topology control algorithms and developing e-kTC, a novel energy-efficient variant of the topology control algorithm kTC. Finally, we evaluate a subset of the algorithms using a novel integration of a wireless network simulator and a graph transformation tool.},

Consequently, these services argue to be complying with existing privacy laws as the data sets allegedly have been pseudonymised. In this paper, we show that the finite pre-image space of PII is bounded in such a way, that an attack on these hashes is significantly eased both theoretically as well as in practice. As a result, the inference from PII hashes to the corresponding PII is intrinsically faster than by performing a naive brute-force attack. We support this statement by an empirical study of breaking PII hashes in order to show that hashing of PII is not a sufficient pseudonymisation technique.}

While the user interfaces and interaction techniques of small-scale 3D printers for household use adapted to the new requirements of non-experts in the last years, such an overhaul of the interfaces for larger machinery is still missing.  In this work, we explore the use of augmented reality methods to support novice users in the operation of CNC milling machines. As a first step towards better support for users, we provide a camera-supported graphical and easy-to-use interface for the measurement of raw workpieces inside the machine.

        abstract = {Graph pattern matching in network topologies is a building block of many distributed algorithms. Based on a limited local view of the topology, pattern-based algorithms substantiate the decisionmaking of each device on the occurrence of graph patterns in its surrounding topology. Existing pattern-based algorithms require that each device has a sufficiently large local view to match patterns without support of other devices. In practical environments, the local view is often restricted to one hop. Thus, algorithms matching non-trivial patterns are locked out from such environments today. This paper presents the first algorithm for distributed topology pattern matching, enabling pattern matching beyond the local view. Outgoing from initiating devices, our pattern matcher delegates the matching procedure to further devices in the network. Exploring major contextual parameters of our algorithm, we show that the optimal local view size depends on scenario-specific conditions. Our pattern matcher provides the flexibility for adaptations of the local view size at runtime. Making use of this flexibility, we optimize the execution of an established pattern-based algorithm and evaluate our pattern matcher in two topology control case studies for the Internet of Things. By scaling the view size of each device in a distributed way, our adaptive approach achieves significant communication cost savings in face of dynamic conditions.}

In contrast to black-outs, energy is available to some extent,{\ensuremath{<}}/div{\ensuremath{>}} {\ensuremath{<}}div{\ensuremath{>}}but not enough to meet the demand of all consumers. Traditional, centrally organized power grids with large production capabilities on the one end of the distribution grid and only consumers on the other end are struggling to cope with brown-out situations. In order to achieve a somewhat fair distribution of the available energy, street busses are supplied in a round-robin-like distribution scheme. For that, some streets busses are supplied with energy, while others encouter local black-outs. Due to the roundrobin-{\ensuremath{<}}/div{\ensuremath{>}} {\ensuremath{<}}div{\ensuremath{>}}like scheme, all consumers receive some energy eventually. Modern, ICT-enhanced ?smart grids? that also include small and local production capabilities (oftentimes renewable energy sources like photovoltaics) provide new means of addressing brown-outs.

By injecting synthetic, yet realistic, attacks into network traces, detection mechanisms can be audited, tested and evaluated. ID2T emerges from the gaps that exist between the arsenals of attackers and defenders. Attackers have the upper hand with 0-day exploits and the malware that utilizes them. Ransomware, for example, makes the headlines more often than ever. The development of modern security mechanisms, on the contrary, is moving slowly. One of the reasons for the slow pace is that there are no clear strategies to evaluate novel defensive proposals. Researchers and security practitioners are forced to use archaic and unrealistic network traces to evaluate their proposals. The DARPA 1999 intrusion detection dataset is such an example. It contains 18-year-old network traces (with no resemblance to modern networks) and old attacks. ID2T stands for \&quot;Intrusion Detection Dataset Toolkit\&quot;. It is an open source toolkit designed to inject synthetic, yet highly realistic attacks, into network traces with the PCAP format. ID2T provides a wide range of modern cyber-attacks for injection; from malware and web application attacks (e.g., against Joomla) to SQL injection and DDoS attacks. Injected attacks are made as realistic as possible by replicating the network conditions and characteristics of any inputted network trace. In this demo session we present the first public release of ID2T, which builds on top of our theoretical work.}

        abstract = {Defending against botnets has always been a cat and mouse game. Cyber-security researchers and government agencies attempt to detect and take down botnets by playing the role of the cat. In this context, a lot of work has been done towards reverse engineering certain variants of malware families as well as understanding the network protocols of botnets to identify their weaknesses (if any) and exploit them. While this is necessary, such an approach offers the botmasters the ability to quickly counteract the defenders by simply performing small changes in their arsenals.  We attempt a different approach by actually taking the role of the Botmaster, to eventually anticipate his behavior. That said, in this presentation, we present a novel computational trust mechanism for fully distributed botnets that allows for a resilient and stealthy management of the infected machines (zombies). We exploit the highly researched area of computational trust to create an autonomous mechanism that ensures the avoidance of common botnet tracking mechanisms such as sensors and crawlers. In our futuristic botnet, zombies are both smart and cautious. They are cautious in the sense that they are careful with whom they communicate with. Moreover, they are smart enough to learn from their experiences and infer whether their fellow zombies are indeed who they claim to be and not government agencies' spies. We study different computational trust models, mainly based on Bayesian inference, to evaluate their advantages and disadvantages in the context of a distributed botnet. Furthermore, we show, via our experimental results, that our approach is significantly stronger than any technique that has been seen in botnets to date. Finally, we step out of the adversarial perspective and touch the topic of countermeasures against our own approach.},

With the LOCAL model, theoretical research already established a common model of locality that has gained little practical relevance. As a result, practical research de facto lacks any common locality model. The only common denominator among practitioners is that a local algorithm is distributed with a restricted scope of interaction. This article closes the gap by introducing four practically motivated classes of locality that successively weaken the strict requirements of the LOCAL model. These classes are applied to categorize and survey 36 local algorithms from 12 different application domains. A detailed comparison shows the practicality of the classification and provides interesting insights. For example, the majority of algorithms limit the scope of interaction to at most two hops, independent of their locality class. Moreover, the application domain of algorithms tends to influence their degree of locality.},

        abstract = {In an attempt to cope with the increased number of cyberattacks, research in Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) is moving towards more collaborative mechanisms. Collaborative IDSs (CIDSs) are such an approach; they combine the knowledge of a plethora of monitors to generate a holistic picture of the monitored network. Despite the research done in this field, CIDSs still face a number of fundamental challenges, especially regarding maintaining trust among the collaborating parties. Recent advances in distributed ledger technologies, e.g. various implementations of blockchain protocols, are a good fit to the problem of enhancing trust in collaborative environments. This paper touches the intersection of CIDSs and blockchains. Particularly, it introduces the idea of utilizing blockchain technologies as a mechanism for improving CIDSs. We argue that certain properties of blockchains can be of significant benefit for CIDSs; namely for the improvement of trust between monitors, and for providing accountability and consensus. For this, we study the related work and highlight the research gaps and challenges towards such a task. Finally, we propose a generic architecture for the incorporation of blockchains into the field of CIDSs and an analysis of the design decisions that need to be made to implement such an architectu\#re.},

        abstract = {Human exploration of large graph structures becomes increasingly difficult with growing graph sizes. A visual representation of such large graphs, for example, social networks and citational networks, has to find a trade-off between showing details in a magnified view and the verall graph structure. Displaying these both aspects at the same time results in an overloaded visualization that is inaccessible for human users. In this paper, we present a new approach to address this issue by combining and extending graph-theoretic properties with community detection algorithms. Our approach is semi-automated and non-destructive. The aim is to retain core properties of the graph while--at the same time--hiding less important side information from the human user. We analyze the results yielded by applying our approach to large real-world network data sets, revealing a massive reduction of displayed nodes and links.}

We believe that increasing privacy awareness and governance will lead to wider adoption of PETs in service infrastructures. To support that, a better understanding of privacy-enhanced services composed out of multiple PETs is necessary. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is no general domain-independent and formal PET model and research about their composition is missing.  The work at hand presents a formal, set-based and domain-independent taxonomy model for PETs, along with an algebra for constrained composition of PETs. The measurement of enforced privacy in service infrastructures with deployed PETs is one of many use cases for such a PET algebra and is demonstrated subsequently in a scenario with two exemplary privacy-enhanced services.},

Anonymity gains more and more importance in the development of communication services.\&nbsp;{\ensuremath{<}}br /{\ensuremath{>}}Thus, anonymity in communication systems is a desired property in many scenarios, allowing to communicate without someone having the ability to attribute the communication to its senders and recipients.\&nbsp;{\ensuremath{<}}br /{\ensuremath{>}}However, sender anonymity, i.e., communication without having an identifiable source of information, is a hard goal and the only viable option to achieve it is cover traffic. Cover traffic blends communication in random noise. However, the generation of this noise degrades the efficiency of the system, in a worst case producing two times the number of connections messages to send just a single message.\&nbsp;{\ensuremath{<}}br /{\ensuremath{>}}Cover traffic as a technique is hardly understood and analyzed. For that, we derived a model of cover traffic with four parameters to vary the generation of noise in location, spread and time to achieve a better understanding of cover traffic. We analyze the impact of varying parameters on anonymity by computing the remaining cover and on efficiency by computing the noise to content ratio. Our results indicate that cover traffic can be generated in a more efficient way while anonymity is preserved on a reasonable level, yet, the parametrization randomizes the participation allowing to diminish anonymity in the long run.},

In social secret sharing-based distributed storage systems, shares of the documents are allocated according to the trustworthiness of the storage servers. This paper proposes a trust mechanism using machine learning techniques to compute evidence-based trust values. Our mechanism mitigates the effect of colluding storage servers. More precisely, it becomes possible to detect unreliable evidence and establish countermeasures in order to discourage the collusion of storage servers. Furthermore, this trust mechanism is applied to the social secret sharing protocol AS3, showing that this new evidence-based trust mechanism enhances the protection of the stored documents.},

Organizations spend high effort in analyzing processes to stay in front of the competition. However, in practice it is a huge challenge to find better processes based on process mining results due to the high complexity of the underlying model. This paper presents a novel approach which provides suggestions for redesigning business processes by using discovered as-is process models from event logs and apply motif-based graph adaptation. Motifs are graph patterns of small size, building the core blocks of graphs. Our approach uses the LoMbA algorithm, which takes a desired motif frequency distribution and adjusts the model to fit that distribution under the consideration of side constraints. The paper presents the underlying concepts, discusses how the motif distribution can be selected and shows the applicability using real-life event logs. Our results show that motif-based graph adaptation adjusts process graphs towards defined improvement goals.}

        abstract = {Reputation systems provide an effective way to build a web of trust on the Internet. They consider the history of interactions between peers to establish a measure for a reputation that can itself be used to support a trust decision. Decentralised reputations systems (DRS) rely on a decentralised computer architecture and a distributed ledger to store and maintain reputation information, so that no single entity has control over that information.  While there have been numerous analyses of how reputation may be used, there has to date been no systematic definition of the various aspects that should be considered when a reputation system is being designed. By defining these design considerations, we can come to a consensus about what is and is not important in a system. We can discuss the different ways in which they can be built and we can conduct further research and analysis into specific factors in a structured way.  We identified ten design considerations for all decentralized reputations should address. These are:  - Context: What is the reputation value applicable to? What can be understood about an entity by seeing their reputation value(s)?  - Participation: How is participation defined? Who can and can?t participate? Who can and can?t have a reputation value assigned?  - User consent: Is consent required by a user to issue claims or a reputation value against the user? Is consent required to reveal claims or a reputation value of a user?  - Confidentiality: To meet consent requirements, how is data that calculates a reputation value kept private? Can it be derived?  - Value generation: How is the reputation value calculated or generated? How are claims contributing to the reputation value normalized?  - Performance: How does the system manage the performance and behavior of the users? How does it manage the performance of the network for speed, reliability, and data integrity? How do users have confidence in this?  - Sustainability: How does the system stay relevant over time?  - Claim lifecycle: How are claims valued over time? Can they be revoked and under what conditions?  - Resilience: How does the system protect against attacks that reduce the integrity of the reputation value?  - Legal: What is the legal environment in which the system sits? Are there potential violations of ?natural? law?  The rest of this paper will further define these considerations and populate each with examples and considerations for their design. We will continue to develop and refine to establish language standards for discussing reputation systems.  We have not defined what is and isn?t required for each consideration, as particular implementations may have differing reasons for each. However, we anticipate that best practices for these considerations will be topics for future analysis.},

However, for the telecommunications sector in particular, most network elements are not usually optimized for power efficiency. In this work, we propose a green routing method in an IP network for the reduction of unnecessary energy consumption. In addition, it can encourage the usage of power generated by renewable energy source instead of traditional fossil energy. As a green networking approach, we first classify the network nodes into either header or member nodes according to the quantity of the available renewable energies. The member nodes then put the routing related module at layer 3 to sleep under the assumption that the layer in the OSI model can operate independently. The whole network nodes are then partitioned into clusters consisting of one header node and multiple member nodes. Then, only the header node in a cluster conducts IP routing and its member nodes conduct packet switching using a specially designed identifier, a tag. To investigate the impact of the proposed scheme, we conducted a number of simulations using \&nbsp;real renewable energy statistics and results show that our approach outperforms the existing solutions in terms of energy efficiency to a large extent.},

To give the reader an introduction into the subject we will first give an overview about the different APIs provided by Windows, Linux and Unix (FreeBSD, Mac OS X) and additional libraries that can be used OS-independent. In the next section we show general problems that have to be addressed by the programmer when working with RAW-sockets. We will then provide an introduction into the steps necessary to use the APIs or libraries, which functionality the different concepts provide to the programmer and what they provide to simplify using RAW and PACKET-sockets. This section includes examples of how to use the different functions provided by the APIs. Finally in the additional material we will give some complete examples that show the concepts and can be used as a basis to write own programs.

        abstract = {{\ensuremath{<}}div{\ensuremath{>}}The introduction of more and more local and distributed energy resources (DER) into the current centralized electrical grid poses new challenges to energy distribution. DERs are significantly smaller in production capabilities than central power plants and their production is highly fluctuating. This means that their influence on the electrical grid is difficult to plan for, especially in brown-out situations, when there is not enough energy available to supply all consumers. This work focuses on the subproblem of fair electricity distribution in brown-out phases. Currently, network segments are switched on and off in a round-robin manner, regardless if there are local producers in these segments or not. However, enabling segments that include local producers more often would improve the overall amount of energy available during the brown-out phases, and thus, this measure would increase the number of supplied consumers. We propose new algorithms that leverage the power of local producers, but still keep a fair energy distribution for all consumers. Therefore, we evolve the current notion of fairness to improve the overall quality of service by taking into account equal supply times as well as maximizing the number of supplied consumers. The proposed algorithms are compared to the current state of the art approach in the German electrical grid. Therefore, extensive simulations based on real-world lowvoltage residential area networks were conducted. The results indicate an improved quality of service during brown-out phases. Moreover, the proposed method is not limited to low-voltage residential areas, but also applies to all hierarchy levels of the energy grid, ranging from the distribution grid down to future households implementing smart grid technologies.{\ensuremath{<}}/div{\ensuremath{>}}}

        abstract = {Today's data center applications can generate a diverse mix of short and long flows. However, switches used in a typical data center network are usually shallow buffered in order to reduce queueing delay and deployment cost. As a result, the buildup of the queues by long flows can block short flows, leading to frequent packet losses and retransmissions, which translates to crucial performance degradation. While multiple end-to-end TCP-based solutions have been proposed, none of them have tackled the real challenge: reliable transmission in the network. In this paper, we fill this gap by presenting PABO -- a novel link-layer design that can mitigate congestion by temporarily bouncing packets to upstream switches. PABO's design fulfills the following demands: i) providing per-flow based flow control on the link layer, ii) handling transient congestion without the intervention of end devices, and iii) gradually back propagating the congestion signal to the source when the network is not capable to handle the congestion. We complete a proof-of-concept implementation, and experiments under different severities of congestion show that PABO outperforms the standard unreliable link-layer protocol by guaranteeing zero packet loss while introducing only a reasonable stretch on packet delay.}

        abstract = {{\ensuremath{<}}div{\ensuremath{>}}Abstract{--}Smart Grids (SGs) are electrical power grid infrastructures that aim at managing both cyber and physical resources and provide efficient energy routing. The cyber part of the system encompasses computing and networking resources, whereas the physical part faces with mechanical and electrical processes. Due to the strong integration and interaction among cyber modules and physical components, the complexity of SGs is increasing. As a consequence, the fulfillment of cyber and physical requirements becomes even more complicated. For example, resilience is an important non-functional requirement that has to be guaranteed. It represents the ability of a system to provide an acceptable level of service under degraded conditions. To achieve that, the adoption of innovative systems engineering tools represent a feasible solution. In this paper, a recent approach based on Properties Modeling (PM) is exploited. Through PM is possible to evaluate cross-information from the Smart Grid to increase the network resilience so as to prevent system damage and, as a consequence, reduce the loss of money. Beyond validating the correctness of the system under specific conditions, properties can also be used to identify anomalies resulting from component interactions or external factors. In this context, some important properties exploitable for monitoring SGs are identified and presented. Furthermore, a Smart Grid Simulator, which allows to execute these properties, has been developed and used to show the effectiveness of properties through a simple case study.{\ensuremath{<}}/div{\ensuremath{>}}},

        abstract = {With the increase in the sophistication of cyber-attacks, collaborative defensive approaches such as Collaborative IDSs (CIDSs) have emerged. CIDSs utilize a multitude of heterogeneous monitors to create a holistic picture of the monitored network. Nowadays, a number of research institutes and companies deploy CIDSs that publish their alert data publicly, over the Internet. Such systems are important for researchers and security administrators as they provide a source of real-world alert data for experimentation. However, a class of attacks exist, called Probe-Response Attacks (PRAs), which can significantly reduce the benefits of a CIDS. In particular, such attacks allow an adversary to detect the network location of the monitors of a CIDS.In this paper, we first study the related work and analyze the various mitigation techniques for defending against PRAs.Subsequently, we propose a novel mitigation mechanism that improves the state of the art. Our method, namely the Shuffle-based PRA Mitigation (SPM), is based on the idea of shuffling the watermarks, so-called markers, which the adversary requires to successfully perform a PRA. By doing so the whole process of the attack is disrupted leading to a very small number of identified monitors. Our experimental results suggest that our proposed method significantly reduces the impact of a PRA whilst it does not introduce a trade-off for the usability of the data produced by the CIDS.},

        abstract = {Work in organisations is often structured into business processes, implemented using process-aware information systems (PAISs). These systems aim to enforce employees to perform work in a certain way, executing tasks in a specified order. However, the execution strategy may change over time, leading to expected and unexpected changes in the overall process. Especially the unexpected changes may manifest without notice, which can have a big impact on the performance, costs, and compliance. Thus it is important to detect these hidden changes early in order to prevent monetary consequences. Traditional process mining techniques are unable to identify these execution changes because they usually generalise without considering time as an extra dimension, and assume stable processes. Most algorithms only produce a single process model, reflecting the behaviour of the complete analysis scope. Small changes cannot be identified as they only occur in a small part of the event log. This paper proposes a method to detect process drifts by performing statistical tests on graph metrics calculated from discovered process models. Using process models allows to additionally gather details about the structure of the drift to answer the question which changes were made to the process.},

        abstract = {Online Social Networks (OSNs) are the core of many social interactions nowadays. Privacy is an important building block of free societies, and thus, for OSNs. Therefore, OSNs should support privacy-enabled communication between citizens that participate. OSNs function as group communication systems and can be build in centralized and distributed styles. Central- ized, privacy is under the sole control of a single entity. If this entity is distributed, privacy can be improved as all participants contribute to privacy. Peer-to-peer-based group communication systems overcome this issue, at the cost of large messaging overhead. The message overhead is mainly caused by early message duplication due to disjunct routing paths. In this paper, we introduce ant colony optimization to reduce the messaging overhead in peer-to-peer-based group communication systems, bridging the gap between privacy and efficiency. To optimize disjunct routing paths, we apply our adapted privacy sensitive ant colony optimization to encourage re-usage and aggregation of known paths. Our results indicate a 9?31\% lower messaging overhead compared to the state of the art. Moreover, our ant colony optimization-based method reuses paths without leaking additional information, that is, we maintain the anonymity sets so that participants remain probable innocent.},

        abstract = {{\ensuremath{<}}div{\ensuremath{>}}In disaster situations or on emergency terrains, Internet and Cloud access may be restricted; it may still be important to process complex resource-intensive tasks and to acquire distributed information for emergency response, using ad-hoc networks among, e.g., first responder mobile devices. Corresponding approaches towards coordination, resource utilization, and interoperability are still challenging. This paper introduces the concept of adaptive task-oriented message templates (ATMT) as a basis for overcoming these issues and for enabling cooperative in-network processing without additional synchronization overhead for mobile devices. An ATMT serves as a self-encapsulated message containing the operation chains that need to be executed as well as the required data. In order to address heterogeneity and interoperability issues, we integrate a lightweight ontology. Depending on the current utilization, devices can autonomously decide whether to participate in the network or not. We evaluate our approach in an indoor testbed with 8 wireless mesh nodes. The results confirm that our approach efficiently supports cooperation among heterogeneous devices towards utilizing available in-network resources while reducing network traffic.{\ensuremath{<}}/div{\ensuremath{>}}},

        abstract = {{\ensuremath{<}}div{\ensuremath{>}}Crowd sensing is an emerging paradigm that utilizes the power of the smart devices within the crowd to collect information. In general, the collected information is aggregated in a cloud server for further analysis. Such centralized analysis model can be at disadvantage in several cases. For instance, in emergency response, where the communication infrastructure is unstable while the results of data analyses are critical for timely relief operations. To cope with this situation, the volunteered processing capabilities of the devices within the crowd can be exploited for data analysis directly in the network. However, exploiting volunteered mobile resources in a decentralized unstable network without coordinated entities is still challenging. For this purpose, we propose an encapsulated message template designed to support in-network data analysis for decentralized ad-hoc network. The demonstration shown in this work showcases the exploitation of volunteered crowd resources to carry out data analysis using our proposed message template.{\ensuremath{<}}/div{\ensuremath{>}}},

Most UGVs and UAVs deployed in the field today depend on human operators and reliable network connections to the vehicles. However, network connections in challenged environments are often lost, thus control can no longer be exercised. In this paper, we present a novel approach to emergency communication where semi-autonomous UGVs and UAVs cooperate with humans to dynamically form communication islands and establish communication bridges between these islands. Humans typically form an island with their mobile devices if they are in physical proximity; UGVs and UAVs extend an island's range by carrying data to a neighboring island. The proposed approach uses delay/disruption-tolerant networking for non-time critical tasks and direct mesh connections for prioritized tasks that require real-time feedback. The developed communication platform runs on rescue robots, commodity mobile devices, and various drones, and supports our operations and control center software for disaster management.},

Modular multi-exponentiation, a generalization of modular exponentiation also used in cryptography, deserves further analysis from the algorithmic point of view. The parallelization of modular multi-exponentiation can be obtained by generalizing methods used to parallelize modular exponentiation. In this paper, we present a new parallelization method for the modular multi-exponentiation operation with two optimizations. The first one searches for the fastest solution without taking into account the number of processors. The second one balances the load among the processors and finds the smallest number of processors that achieves the fastest solution. In detail, our algorithms compute the product of i modular exponentiations. They split up each exponent in j blocks and start j threads. Each thread processes together i blocks from different exponents. Thus, each block of an exponent is processed in a different thread, but the blocks of different exponents are processed together in the same thread. Using addition chains, we show the minimum number of threads with load balance and optimal running time. Therefore, the algorithms are optimized to run with the minimum time and the minimum number of processors.},

        abstract = {Resilience is an important system property that relies on the ability of a system to automatically recover from a degraded state so as to continue providing its services. Resilient systems have the means of detecting faults and failures with the added capability of automatically restoring their normal operations. Mastering resilience in the domain of Cyber-Physical Systems is challenging due to the interdependence of hybrid hardware and software components, along with physical limitations, laws, regulations and standards, among others. In order to overcome these challenges, this paper presents a modeling approach, based on the concept of Dynamic Cells, tailored to the management of Smart Grids. Additionally, a heuristic algorithm that works on top of the proposed modeling approach, to find resilient \&nbsp;configurations, has been defined and implemented. More specifically, the model supports a flexible representation of Smart Grids and the algorithm is able to manage, at different abstraction levels, the resource consumption of individual grid elements on the presence of failures and faults. Finally, the proposal is evaluated in a test scenario where the effectiveness of such approach, when dealing with complex scenarios where adequate solutions are difficult to find, is shown.},

        abstract = {Due to the growing complexity of processes, regulations, policies and guidelines (e.g., Sarbanes-Oxley-Act) computer-assisted business process analysis - known as process mining - is becoming more and more relevant for organisations. One discipline of process mining is backward compliance checking, which aims to detect non-compliant process variants based on historic data. Most existing approaches compare the "as-is" view with desired process models. However, most organisations do not maintain such models, making such approaches less attractive. This paper proposes a process flow analysis which uses graph-reachability to check whether the actual "as-is" process graph violates compliance constraints. Our approach is inspired by the taint flow algorithm which is used in code analysis to identify security vulnerabilities in software applications. We conducted a case study evaluating the compliance of event logs and performed a benchmark to show that our approach outperforms the LTL checker and the PetriNet pattern approach in ProM.},

The inherently complex nature and quantity of network data impedes detecting attacks in real world settings. In this paper, we utilize features of network flows, characterized by their entropy, together with an extended version of the original Replicator Neural Network (RNN) and deep learning techniques to learn models of normality. This combination allows us to apply anomaly-based intrusion detection on arbitrarily large amounts of data and, consequently, large networks. Our approach is unsupervised and requires no labeled data. It also accurately detects network-wide anomalies without presuming that the training data is completely free of attacks. The evaluation of our intrusion detection method, on top of real network data, indicates that it can accurately detect resource exhaustion attacks and network profiling techniques of varying intensities. The developed method is efficient because a normality model can be learned by training an RNN within a few seconds only.},

        abstract = {The prosperous growth of the Internet-of-Things industry attracts numerous interests in employing edge clouds (a.k.a. cloudlets) to enhance the performance of mobile services and applications. Most existing research has been focused on offloading computational tasks from mobile devices to a single cloudlet or a central location, yet overlooked the issue of jointly coordinating the offloaded tasks in a system of multiple cloudlets. In this paper, we fill this gap by investigating the assignment and the scheduling of mobile computational tasks over multiple cloudlets, while optimizing the overall cost efficiency by leveraging the heterogeneity of cloudlets. We model both data transfer and computation in terms of monetary and time costs, with task deadlines guaranteed. We formulate the problem as a mixed integer program and prove its NP-hardness. By introducing admission control for the cloudlet provider to shape the system workload, we transform our problem into maximizing the task admission rate over the two coupled phases: data transfer and computation. We propose an efficient two-phase scheduling algorithm, and demonstrate that, compared with the conventional approach of always selecting the closest cloudlet, our approach achieves significantly higher admission rate with up to 20{$\backslash$}\% reduction in the average cost of all offloaded tasks.}

In this context, the paper presents a new formal requirement modeling language based on temporal logic, called FORM-L, and a software library, based on the Modelica language, that implements the constructs provided by FORM-L so as to enable the visual modeling of system properties as well as their verification through simulation. The effectiveness of the proposal is shown on a real case study concerning an Intermediate Cooling System.}

In the case of railway traffic, the consequences of locomotive failure are not limited to the affected machine, but are propagated through the railway network and may affect public transport as well. Therefore it is desirable to predict and avoid failures. In order to do this, constant monitoring of the trains? systems and measurement of the relevant variables is required, but often not implemented. In this paper we leverage the existing technology of the 185 locomotive series and build a layered model for power converter failure prediction that can be applied without additional technology. We train instance anomaly detectors based on the pattern structure of the locomotives? diagnostic messages from historical data records. For this purpose we selected rule and decision tree learning because they can be easily implemented in the existing software, whereas more complex classifiers would require costly software adaptations. In order to predict a time series of instances, we construct a meta classification layer. We then evaluate our model on the data of 180 locomotive tours by leave one out classification. The results show that the meta classifier improves classification accuracy, which will allow us to use this technology in a fielded prototype installation without disturbing daily operations.}

        abstract = {Business processes are prone to subtle changes over time, as unwanted behavior slowly manifests in the execution flow. This problem is related to anomaly detection, as these subtle changes start of as anomalies at first, and thus it is important to detect them early. However, the necessary process documentation is often outdated, and thus not usable. Moreover, the only way of analyzing a process in execution is the use of event logs coming from process-aware information systems, but these event logs already contain anomalous behavior and other sorts of noise. Classic process anomaly detection algorithms require a dataset that is free of anomalies; thus, they are unable to process the noisy event logs. Within this paper we propose a system, relying on neural network technology, that is able to deal with the noise in the event log and learn a representation of the underlying model, and thus detect anomalous behavior based on this representation. We evaluate our approach on five different event logs, coming from process models with different complexities, and demonstrate that our approach yields remarkable results of 97.2 percent F1-score in detecting anomalous traces in the event log, and 95.6 percent accuracy in detecting the respective anomalous activities within the traces.}

        abstract = {Cyber-attacks are steadily increasing in both their size and sophistication. To cope with this, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are considered mandatory for the protection of critical infrastructure. Furthermore, research is currently focusing on collaborative architectures for IDSs, creating a Collaborative IDS (CIDS). In such a system a number of IDS monitors work together towards creating a holistic picture of the monitored network. Nevertheless, a class of attacks exists, called probe-response, which can assist adversaries to detect the network position of CIDS monitors. This can significantly affect the advantages of a CIDS. In this paper, we introduce PREPARE, a framework for deploying probe-response attacks and also for studying methods for their mitigation. Moreover, we present significant improvements on both the effectiveness of probe-response attacks as well as on mitigation techniques for detecting them. We evaluate our approach via an extensive simulation and a real-world attack deployment that targets two CIDSs. Our results show that our framework can be practically utilized, that our proposals significantly improve probe-response attacks and, lastly, that the introduced detection and mitigation techniques are effective.},

        abstract = {The development of high quality complex software systems and quick time-to-market with full customer satisfaction often appear as two competing forces. Many industry efforts have been directed towards agile methodologies completed with the DevOps approach, whereas traditional requirements engineering with much documentation, is considered surpassed. The aim is to obtain a longer life software because it suddenly responds to the customers changing requirements from which it receives continuous input. This might create a serious cost implication and a real risk to lose system requirements control. In this paper, we propose a framework able to govern the complexity of the system requirements and to allow the embedding, occasionally, of technological innovations into the overall system. ResDevOps joins the value of the agile world with DevOps, with the additional value deriving from an unceasing parallel innovation management process, which we call ResDevs. ResDevOps includes a continuous research and innovation process, which provides an asynchronous, additional input to the agile process inside a chain of concurrent engineering collaboration. This is a suitable trade-off to maintain modern IT Systems live for a longer time, with many consequent advantages for both total investment and system quality. The practical use of the ResDevOps approach is shown by means of a case study.}

        abstract = {Cyber-attacks have nowadays become more frightening than ever before. The growing dependency of our society on networked systems aggravates these threats; from interconnected corporate networks and Industrial Control Systems (ICSs) to smart households, the attack surface for the adversaries is increasing. At the same time, it is becoming evident that the utilization of classic fields of security research alone, e.g., cryptography, or the usage of isolated traditional defense mechanisms, e.g., firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems ( IDSs ), is not enough to cope with the imminent security challenges.  To move beyond monolithic approaches and concepts that follow a ?cat and mouse? paradigm between the defender and the attacker, cyber-security research requires novel schemes. One such promis- ing approach is collaborative intrusion detection. Driven by the lessons learned from cyber-security research over the years, the aforesaid notion attempts to connect two instinctive questions: ?if we acknowledge the fact that no security mechanism can detect all attacks, can we beneficially combine multiple approaches to operate together?? and ?as the adversaries increasingly collaborate (e.g., Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks from whichever larger botnets) to achieve their goals, can the defenders beneficially collude too??. Collabora- tive intrusion detection attempts to address the emerging security challenges by providing methods for IDSs and other security mech- anisms (e.g., firewalls and honeypots) to combine their knowledge towards generating a more holistic view of the monitored network.  This thesis improves the state of the art in collaborative intrusion detection in several areas. In particular, the dissertation proposes methods for the detection of complex attacks and the generation of the corresponding intrusion detection signatures. Moreover, a novel approach for the generation of alert datasets is given, which can assist researchers in evaluating intrusion detection algorithms and systems. Furthermore, a method for the construction of communities of collab- orative monitoring sensors is given, along with a domain-awareness approach that incorporates an efficient data correlation mechanism. With regard to attacks and countermeasures, a detailed methodology is presented that is focusing on sensor-disclosure attacks in the con- text of collaborative intrusion detection.  The scientific contributions can be structured into the following categories:  Alert data generation: This thesis deals with the topic of alert data generation in a twofold manner: first it presents novel approaches for detecting complex attacks towards generating alert signatures for IDSs ; second a method for the synthetic generation of alert data is pro- posed. In particular, a novel security mechanism for mobile devices is proposed that is able to support users in assessing the security status of their networks. The system can detect sophisticated attacks and generate signatures to be utilized by IDSs . The dissertation also touches the topic of synthetic, yet realistic, dataset generation for the evaluation of intrusion detection algorithms and systems; it proposes a novel dynamic dataset generation concept that overcomes the short- comings of the related work.  Collaborative intrusion detection: As a first step, the the- sis proposes a novel taxonomy for collaborative intrusion detection ac- companied with building blocks for Collaborative IDSs ( CIDSs ). More- over, the dissertation deals with the topics of (alert) data correlation and aggregation in the context of CIDSs . For this, a number of novel methods are proposed that aim at improving the clustering of mon- itoring sensors that exhibit similar traffic patterns. Furthermore, a novel alert correlation approach is presented that can minimize the messaging overhead of a CIDS.  Attacks on CIDSs: It is common for research on cyber-defense to switch its perspective, taking on the viewpoint of attackers, trying to anticipate their remedies against novel defense approaches. The the- sis follows such an approach by focusing on a certain class of attacks on CIDSs that aim at identifying the network location of the monitor- ing sensors. In particular, the state of the art is advanced by proposing a novel scheme for the improvement of such attacks. Furthermore, the dissertation proposes novel mitigation techniques to overcome both the state of art and the proposed improved attacks.  Evaluation: All the proposals and methods introduced in the dis- sertation were evaluated qualitatively, quantitatively and empirically. A comprehensive study of the state of the art in collaborative intru- sion detection was conducted via a qualitative approach, identifying research gaps and surveying the related work. To study the effective- ness of the proposed algorithms and systems extensive simulations were utilized. Moreover, the applicability and usability of some of the contributions in the area of alert data generation was additionally supported via Proof of Concepts (PoCs) and prototypes.  The majority of the contributions were published in peer-reviewed journal articles, in book chapters, and in the proceedings of interna- tional conferences and workshops.}

        abstract = {Botnets are increasingly being held responsible for most of the cybercrimes that occur nowadays. They are used to carry out malicious activities like banking credential theft and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks to generate profit for their owner, the botmaster. Traditional botnets utilized centralized and decentralized Command-and-Control Servers (C2s). However, recent botnets have been observed to prefer P2P-based architectures to overcome some of the drawbacks of the earlier architectures.   A P2P architecture allows botnets to become more resilient and robust against random node failures and targeted attacks. However, the distributed nature of such botnets requires the defenders, i.e., researchers and law enforcement agencies, to use specialized tools such as crawlers and sensor nodes to monitor them. In return to such monitoring, botmasters have introduced various countermeasures to impede botnet monitoring, e.g., automated blacklisting mechanisms.   The presence of anti-monitoring mechanisms not only render any gathered monitoring data to be inaccurate or incomplete, it may also adversely affect the success rate of botnet takedown attempts that rely upon such data. Most of the existing monitoring mechanisms identified from the related works only attempt to tolerate anti-monitoring mechanisms as much as possible, e.g., crawling bots with lower frequency. However, this might also introduce noise into the gathered data, e.g., due to the longer delay for crawling the botnet. This in turn may also reduce the quality of the data.   This dissertation addresses most of the major issues associated with monitoring in P2P botnets as described above. Specifically, it analyzes the anti-monitoring mechanisms of three existing P2P botnets: 1) GameOver Zeus, 2)Sality, and 3) ZeroAccess, and proposes countermeasures to circumvent some of them. In addition, this dissertation also proposes several advanced anti-monitoring mechanisms from the perspective of a botmaster to anticipate future advancement of the botnets. This includes a set of lightweight crawler detection mechanisms as well as several novel mechanisms to detect sensor nodes deployed in P2P botnets. To ensure that the defenders do not loose this arms race, this dissertation also includes  countermeasures to circumvent the proposed anti-monitoring mechanisms. Finally, this dissertation also investigates if the presence of third party monitoring mechanisms, e.g., sensors, in botnets influences the overall churn measurements. In addition, churn models for Sality and ZeroAccess are also derived using fine-granularity churn measurements.   The works proposed in this dissertation have been evaluated using either real-world botnet datasets, i.e., that were gathered using crawlers and sensor nodes, or simulated datasets. Evaluation results indicate that most of the anti-monitoring mechanisms implemented by existing botnets can either be circumvented or tolerated to obtain monitoring data with a better quality. However, many crawlers and sensor nodes in existing botnets are found vulnerable to the  antimonitoring mechanisms that are proposed from the perspective of a botmaster in this dissertation. Analysis of the fine-grained churn measurements for Sality and ZeroAccess indicate that churn in these botnets are similar to that of regular P2P file-sharing networks like Gnutella and Bittorent. In addition, the presence of highly responsive sensor nodes in the botnets are found not influencing the overall churn measurements. This is mainly due to low number of sensor nodes currently deployed in the botnets. Existing and future botnet monitoring mechanisms should apply the findings of this dissertation to ensure high quality monitoring data, and to remain undetected from the bots or the botmasters.}

However, these solutions have so far failed to find widespread adoption due to poor performance and usability. What is missing is an Internet access that offers a decent level of privacy for average users out of the box. In this paper, we survey suitable lightweight anonymity solutions and present avenues for future research so that Internet service providers can offer anonymity online without compromising performance and usability, i.e. an effortless solution for customers.}

        abstract = {IT departments of organisations go to great lengths to protect their IT infrastructure from external attackers. However, internal attacks also pose a large threat to organisations. Despite detection and prevention of insider attacks being an active field of research, so far such techniques are rarely being deployed in practice. This paper outlines the state of the art in the field and identifies open research problems in the area. The lack of unified definitions and publicly available datasets for evaluation is detrimental to the comparability of published results in the field and hinders the continual improvement of technology. Another important problem is that of data protection: On the one hand, the data captured for insider attack detection could also be used for surveillance of employees, so it should be anonymised. On the other hand, anonymisation may make some attacks undetectable, leading to a trade-off between detectability of attacks and privacy.},

Micro grids circumvent blackouts by leveraging these local producers to power a fixed subset of consumers. In this paper, we evolve micro grids to Holons, which overcome the need for fixed subsets and power as much of the city network as possible. We contribute a formal model of Holons and investigate the impact of the Holon concept in a simulation with 10,000 randomly generated city networks. These city networks are based on parameters obtained from a real-world test site in a medium-sized German city. Our results show that the Holon approach can supply an average fraction of 22.08\% of any city network, even when fixed micro grids would fail to power the city network as a whole.},

With this in mind, the research community has been immersed in the field of IDSs over the past years more than before. Still, assessing and comparing performance between different systems and algorithms remains one of the biggest challenges in this research area. IDSs need to be evaluated and compared against high quality datasets; nevertheless, the existing ones have become outdated or lack many essential requirements. We present the Intrusion Detection Dataset Toolkit (ID2T), an approach for creating out-of-the-box labeled datasets that contain user defined attacks. In this paper, we discuss the essential requirements needed to create synthetic, yet realistic, datasets with user defined attacks. We also present typical problems found in synthetic datasets and propose a software architecture for building tools that can cope with the most typical problems. A publicly available prototype, is implemented and evaluated. The evaluation comprises a performance analysis and a quality assessment of the generated datasets. We show that our tool can handle large amounts of network traffic and that it can generate synthetic datasets without the problems or shortcomings we identified in other datasets.},

In this paper we present a novel honeypot capable of detecting multi-stage attacks targeting ICS networks. Upon detecting a multi-stage attack, our honeypot can generate signatures so that misuse Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) can subsequently thwart attacks of the same type. Our experimental results indicate that our honeypot and the signatures it generates provide good detection accuracy and that the Bro IDS can successfully use the signatures to prevent future attacks.},

        abstract = {The Internet faces ever faster and stronger dynamics in the behavior patterns of its users and hence, in the imposed load and traffic. However, the various ?mechanisms? used within the Internet{--}communication protocols and their functional components, overlays, middleware, etc.{--}cannot be sufficiently adapted at runtime: parameter adaptation is common practice, but the replacement of a mechanism by one that is functionally similar yet more appropriate{--}for the benefit of performance and quality{--}is rare. Those rare cases are tediously engineered case by case since on-the-fly transitions between similar mechanisms are not promoted by today?s Internet construction principles. In light of the considerations above, the present whitepaper advocates mechanism transitions as a fundamental new principle for the Internet and makes inroads into its modeling and specification. The quest for a fundamentally more flexible Internet is not only fueled by trends regarding users and applications ?above?, but also by innovations in the network technology ?below?: Software-defined systems and networks emerge as an enabling technology for more flexibility, but cannot be sufficiently leveraged for more flexibility in the Internet as a whole. The German Collaborative Research Center MAKI investigates appropriate models, concepts and methods as well as prerequisites and benefits in regard to mechanism transitions in the Future Internet. The present whitepaper comprises approaches to the modeling and specification of such mechanism transitions, both from a structural and a behavioral perspective, as developed over the last three years. The various other aspects of MAKI, such as investigations of particular sets of mechanism or monitoring and control aspects, are not covered here. The whitepaper starts by providing a more detailed discussion of the quest for Internet mechanism transitions and of related issues. It continues by introducing the basic MAKI architecture and terminology in comparison to those of the OSI standard and the Internet. In the sequel, different approaches to the general structural and behavioral modeling and specification of mechanism transitions are presented, as developed and used in MAKI. The presented research contributions were created with different purposes and focuses in mind; they represent important steps forward on our path towards a consolidated framework for mechanism transitions. In other words, they make inroads into a highly dynamic Future Internet that can cope with ever increasing dynamics. We will use terminology from the ISO OSI standard as a starting point for introducing our terms and concepts. For readers with limited knowledge in this underlying standard, we provide a short OSI terminology primer in the appendix.},

        abstract = {Multitasking and interruptions in information work make frequent activity switches necessary. Individuals need to recall and restore earlier states of work which generally involves retrieval of information objects. To avoid resulting tooling time an activity-centric organization of information objects has been proposed. For each activity a collection with related information objects (like documents, websites etc.) is created to improve information access and serve as a memory aid.  While the manual maintenance of such information collections is a tedious task and becomes an interruption on its own, the automatic maintenance of such collections using activity mining is promising. Activity mining utilizes interaction histories to extract unique activities based on the stream of interaction with information objects. For activity mining, existing work shows varying success in limited study setups.  In this paper, we present a method for activity mining to generate activity-centric information object collections automatically from interaction histories. The technique is a hybrid approach considering all information types used in previous work -- activity stream and accessed content related information. Method performance is evaluated based on interaction histories collected during real work data from eight information workers collected over several weeks. For the dataset our hybrid approach shows on average a performance of 0.53 ARI up to 0.77 ARI, outperforming single metric-based approaches.},

        abstract = {Publish-subscribe is an increasingly popular messaging pattern for distributed systems, supporting scalable and extensible programming, and optimal spatial, temporal, and control-flow decoupling of distributed components. Publish-subscribe middleware and methods were extended towards supporting security, in particular confidentiality, and increased availability, yet a few prior works addressed anonymity of participants. Anonymity of senders and receivers may however be crucial, e.g., for supporting freedom of expression in regimes where political repression and censorship prevail. In this article, we review basic security and privacy requirements and introduce a new attacker model based on statistical disclosure, used to challenge anonymity. We elaborate on design options for privacy-preserving publish-subscribe systems and present a novel system that leverages peer-to-peer networking concepts; this novel approach protects subscriber anonymity by means of Probabilistic Forwarding (PF) and through a novel so-called Shell Game (SG) algorithm. We verify our solution against the requirements and provide a simulation-based analysis of the effectiveness of our approaches in light of our attacker model. The results show that the SG algorithm efficiently protects subscriber anonymity, and that anonymity sets can be adjusted via PF.}

        abstract = {3D printing is widely used to physically prototype the look and feel of 3D objects. However, interaction possibilities of these prototypes are often limited to mechanical parts or post-assembled electronics. Moreover, fabricating interactive 3D printed objects is still an expert task. In my dissertation, I therefore explore how to support users in the design of interactive 3D objects and how to automate the generation of adequate sensing structures. Further, I investigate tangible interaction concepts for 3D printed objects. In this paper, I outline my past and future research towards the fabrication of 3D objects in terms of (1) user-friendly design, (2) automation of fabrication, and (3) tangible interaction concepts for the input modalities touch and deformation.}

        abstract = {Der Nutzung von Standortinformationen, sowohl zur Verbesserung des Benutzererlebnisses existierender Applikation als auch als Basis neuer Applikation, hat in den letzten Jahren verst{\"a}rktes Interesse erfahren. Speziell seit der Vorstellung des Bluetooth-basierten Apple iBeacon-Systems zur Auslieferung von ortsabh{\"a}ngiger Werbung richtet sich dabei die Aufmerksamkeit auf die Standortbestimmung innerhalb von Geb{\"a}uden. {\"U}ber den Konstruktionszweck hinaus ergeben sich hier vielf{\"a}ltige Anwendungsm{\"o}glichkeiten - gro{\ss}es Potenzial haben Standortinformationen dabei insbesondere f{\"u}r die Optimierung der unterschiedlichsten Prozesse im Bereich des Facility Managements. Neben Potentialen bei der Verbesserung gemeinsam genutzter Ressourcen, wie etwa Meetingr{\"a}umen, zur Betriebszeit oder Navigationsunterst{\"u}tzung f{\"u}r ortsunkundige Gesch{\"a}ftspartner, k{\"o}nnten standortbasierte Systeme beispielsweise Handwerkern in der Konstruktionsphase oder Rettungskr{\"a}ften im Brandfall unterst{\"u}tzen. H{\"a}ufig genutzt f{\"u}r die Konstruktion solcher Systeme werden vor allem die ohnehin vorhandene Infrastruktur zur drahtlosen Vernetzung (Wi-Fi) und die o.g. Bluetooth-Beacons. Naheliegend ist au{\ss}erdem die Verwendung von Smartphones, welche mittlerweile standardm{\"a}{\ss}ig {\"u}ber die beiden genannten sowie eine Vielzahl weiterer Sensoren verf{\"u}gen. Bisher entwickelte Systeme zur Standortbestimmung in Geb{\"a}uden bieten jedoch h{\"a}ufig nur begrenzte Flexibilit{\"a}t durch festgelegte Sensoren und Berechnungsverfahren und sind durch hohe Wartungsaufw{\"a}nde in ihrer Skalierbarkeit eingeschr{\"a}nkt. Mit Blick auf einen dauerhaften und fl{\"a}chendeckenden Einsatz eines solchen Standortbestimmungssystems innerhalb eines Unternehmens zeigen sich bei existierenden L{\"o}sungen zudem oftmals Defizite im Bereich der Energieeffizienz. In dieser Arbeit wurde daher ein Smartphone basiertes System entwickelt, das die Idee verschiedener modularer Verarbeitungs-Pipelines nutzt, um eine flexible Architektur zu realisieren, die es erlaubt, die Verarbeitung von Sensordaten mit dem Zweck der Standortbestimmung leicht den Anforderungen der Umgebung entsprechend zu konfigurieren und bei Bedarf auch neue Sensoren oder Berechnungsverfahren in das System zu integrieren. F{\"u}r dieses System wurden Module zur Unterst{\"u}tzung von Bluetooth, Wi-Fi und GPS-Sensoren sowie einer Vielzahl g{\"a}ngiger Verfahren zum Musterabgleich oder der Nachbarschaftsdetektion umgesetzt. Dabei wurde sowohl die Verarbeitung der Daten einzelner Sensoren untersucht und optimiert als auch ein Verfahren zur Fusionierung von Berechnungsergebnissen mehrerer Sensoren entwickelt. Dar{\"u}ber hinaus wird ein Ansatz vorgestellt, der mittels eines Bewegungszustandsgraphen die Benutzerbewegung und -Position erfasst und die Konfiguration der Sensoren des Systems entsprechend energetisch optimiert. Um die Leistungsf{\"a}higkeit des Systems, insbesondere im Hinblick auf die Genauigkeit der Standortbestimmung zu untersuchen, wurde das System in einer umfangreichen Evaluation unter unterschiedlichen Infrastrukturbedingungen getestet; die Evaluation fand dabei in einem B{\"u}rokomplex bei laufendem Betrieb statt. Aus den Evaluationsergebnissen wurde eine optimale Konfiguration f{\"u}r das System abgeleitet, mit welcher eine Median-Genauigkeit von 2m erreicht wird, und bei deren Einsatz das System in 89 \% der F{\"a}lle einen maximalen Fehler unter 5m liefert, d.h. einen Abstand, in dem ein menschlicher Nutzer leicht sein Ziel erkennen kann.},

P2P- based anonymous publish-subscribe (pub-sub) is a highly-scalable approach to protect anonymity while enabling efficient many- to-many communication between services and users. However, churn and overlay degradation in P2P-based pub-sub systems require periodic repair and optimization operations to maintain the anonymity protection and the efficiency of the content dissemination. This paper analyzes attacks on such repair and optimization functions to disclose publishers and subscribers. For that, we apply a strong attacker model that combines large- scale traffic monitoring with malicious insiders. Furthermore, we propose and evaluate heuristic countermeasures. Our findings indicate that some attacks can be mitigated at reasonable costs. However, churn seems to remain a major threat to anonymity.},

        abstract = {Freedom of speech is a core value of our society. While it can be exercised anonymously towards undesired observers in the physical world, the Internet is based on unique and nonanonymous identifiers (IDs) for every participant. Anonymity, however, is a crucial requirement to exercise freedom of speech using the Internet without having to face political persecution. To achieve anonymity, messages must be unlinkable to senders an receivers. That means that messages cannot be linked to IDs and other identifying information of senders and receivers. Anonymization services, such as Tor, re-establish anonymity within the Internet such that, for example, web content can be consumed anonymously. Nevertheless, this type of solution embodies two challenges: First, with the appearance of social media, the Internet usage behavior changed drastically from a one producer with many consumers to a many producers with many consumers of content paradigm. Second, a social media website that is used by many producers and many consumers constitutes a single point of failure (SPoF) regarding both availability and anonymity. Such a website may collect producer and consumer profiles, ultimately breaking anonymity. Publish/subscribe (pub/sub) is a message dissemination paradigm well suited to address the first challenge, the many-to-many exchange of content. peer-to-peer (P2P) Pub/Sub eliminates the need for an SPoF and, thus, partially addresses the second challenge as well. However, research addressing anonymity as a security requirement for Pub/Sub has merely scratched the surface. This thesis improves the state-of-the-art in anonymous Pub/Sub in several areas. In particular, the thesis addresses the following aspects of constructing anonymous Pub/Sub systems: (i.) Building blocks that reduce the complexity of constructing anonymous Pub/Sub systems are proposed; (ii.) methods for anonymously establishing Pub/Sub overlay networks are presented; (iii.) a method for inter-overlay optimization to distribute load is introduced; (iv.) methods for optimizing overlays regarding anonymity are proposed, and (v.) anonymity attacks and countermeasures are presented.  Contributions. This thesis contributes to the following research categories:  Anonymous overlay establishment: An anonymous Pub/Sub system is presented along six self-containing building blocks with the goal of establishing overlay networks that transport notifications from publishers to subscribers. Each building block is discussed in detail with a focus on leveraging related work to realize the building block. For attribute localization, the building block most relevant for establishing overlays, this thesis proposes multiple contributions: the usage of hash chains as a privacy-preserving transaction pseudonym and distance metric; the adaptation of flooding as well as forest fires; and random walks to distribute attribute knowledge.  Anonymous overlay optimization: The thesis proposes two optimizations for anonymity and one optimization for balancing the load. The first anonymity optimization, probabilistic forwarding (PF), applies the concept of mimic traffic to the domain of Pub/Sub. The second anonymity optimization, the shell game (SG), shuffles the overlay. Both optimizations prevent an exposure of information to attackers that can gain knowledge about the overlay topology. The load-balancing optimization uses a ring communication and Bloom filters to distribute load among nodes.  Anonymity attacks and countermeasures: Several well-known anonymity attacks are adapted to the domain of anonymous Pub/Sub and evaluated in detail. Novel attacks, such as the request/response-attack and the corner attack, are proposed as well and complemented with countermeasures.  Evaluation. The proposed mechanisms and attacks are evaluated using a qualitative approach, quantitatively with an extensive simulation, and empirically with a proof of concept (POC) application. The qualitative approach indicates that the presented mechanisms are well-suited to protect anonymity against a malicious insider threat. The quantitative evaluation is performed with the event-based simulation framework OMNeT++. The results show that the presented anonymous Pub/Sub system can protect anonymity, even in case malicious insiders are combined with a global observer of a very strong anonymity threat. The results also reveal in which situations PF or the SG provides the better anonymity protection. Furthermore, the results indicate which capabilities are favorable for an anonymity attacker. An anonymous micro-blogging application for Twitter shows that the presented system can be implemented for a real-world use case: With the application, users exchange tweets via hashtag-overlays, and cryptographic keys via quick response (QR)-codes and near field communication (NFC).}

        abstract = {Graph-based topology control adapts wireless topologies to achieve certain target graph structures. Wireless sensor networks seem well-suited for the expectations (in particular those on provided energy savings) raised by topology control. Nevertheless, topology control has never made the breakthrough in real-world deployments. This work explores the reasons for this, identifying five practical obstacles of today?s topology control: (i) unrealistic assumptions, (ii) unsuitable graph structures, (iii) application agnosticism, (iv) unclear role in the stack, and (v) insufficient framework support. To address the latter obstacle, we provide a re-usable framework for the implementation and evaluation of topology control. Based on this framework, we conduct a testbed-based evaluation for two application scenarios and three topology control algorithms including a novel application-specific algorithm. Indeed, the identified obstacles hinder topology control from boosting the application. However, the achieved graph structures show the practical feasibility of topology control in principle.},

However, security breaches in these systems may allow attackers to tamper with archived documents without being noticed. To address this threat, standardized archiving systems require a public key infrastructure, where a time-stamp authority is trusted to date and sign stored documents periodically. However, in practice a time-stamp authority may not be fully trustworthy, allowing an attacker to forge documents. Thus, in this paper, we introduce a novel reputation-based trust system for time-stamping-based archiving called Long-term evaluation of Trust (LoT), which alleviates the required trust assumptions. This makes LoT an important contribution to realize trust and security management for digital archiving systems using public key infrastructures. We implemented LoT showcasing its applicability to electronic health records and demonstrate its efficacy by simulations.},

        abstract = {Providing reliable and coherent interfaces to end-users in pervasive environments with a wealth of connected sensors and actuators is still an area with little to no support in terms of common methodologies and established standards. The wide range of diverse situations, in which interaction in these environments potentially takes place, prevents any single means of interaction to form a predominant approach. While one class of interaction devices, might be well suited in one given situation, it might be wholly inapplicable in another. Yet, users rightfully expect an interaction session to continue coherently when their situation calls for a change with regard to their means of interaction.  The entailing classes of new requirements for user interfaces, such as distributed interaction logic, guaranteed coherence with regard to the state of the overall interaction and the necessity to effectively support multiple modalities as equals are addressed only insufficiently by the established approaches to model user interface that are popular today. Much research has already been conducted in the last 50 years to develop various conceptualizations applicable to model distributed, coherent, and / or multimodal interfaces, but so far this only lead to a plethora of isolated research prototypes and solutions to specific problems in the design space, with no solution having developed the inertia to succeed in establishing a permanent foothold in industry-supported, commercial end-user applications. While first applications are, indeed, starting to be commercialized, {$\backslash$}eg as seen on IFA 2015 and even earlier fairs, their lack of a standardized approach is still a serious obstacle to commodification: Having a BMW tell a Buderus central heating system that a user expects a warm living room in 30 minutes is appreciated, but the overall usefulness is diminished if one needs to change into the VW only to check on the contents of a Miele fridge, losing all interaction context in between.    In this thesis, we will elaborate on an approach, recently recommended by the "W3C Multimodal Interaction Working Group", to express the interaction logic of user interfaces in pervasive environments as modality-agnostic, nested state-charts controlling modality-specific components. The major contribution is a description of an automated transformation from these state-charts, given in an XML dialect onto the input language of a model-checker. This allows an interface designer to formally guarantee certain behaviors of the state-charts and thereby properties of the interaction described within. This core contribution is evaluated by (i) identifying the subset of state-chart semantics applicable for formal verification, (ii) approaching a proof of correctness of the transformation via the official tests accompanying the state-chart description language and by (iii) showing applicability of the overall approach via transforming a non-trivial state-chart employed to describe the user interface of a commercial consumer product.  Several smaller contributions of this thesis include (i) a proof of the Turing completeness of the employed state-chart semantics as well as the embedding of a push-down automaton, (ii) a transformation onto semantically equivalent state-machines in a slightly extended variant of the state-chart description language with (iii) a closed-form upper bound for the number of states in the state-machine (iv) and extensions to improve the applicability and expressiveness of the proposed state-chart formalism with regard to other established dialog modeling techniques.  All of this is actually implemented in a platform-independent C++ state-chart interpreter, compliant to the respective W3C standards and accompanied by various tools available under a free open-source license. The interpreter is already used in commercial deployments of multimodal dialog systems and was submitted as part of the implementation and report plan for the respective W3C recommendation.}

Reasons for such declines of attentiveness are increasing fatigue and decreasing concentration having strong influence on the effectiveness of lectures and students' retention. In such situations, it is recommended to change the teaching method or to interrupt the lecture by short breaks. For the lecturer, however, it is difficult to predict and recognize a decline of attention while teaching. Measurements of attentiveness are either based on physiological measures or observational measures. Both are neither reliable nor practical for lecture hall settings. To address this problem, we propose a system called 'Classquake' that uses students' smartphones as decentralized sensors to measure their activity and attentiveness during lectures.}

In CIDSs, a number of IDS sensors work together for creating a holistic picture of the monitored network. Our contribution in this paper is a novel distributed and scalable CIDS, called SkipMon. Our system supports, both, the idea of locality and privacy preserving communication by means of exchanging compact alert data. Furthermore, we propose a mechanism for interconnecting sensors that experience similar traffic patterns. The experimental results suggest that our CIDS, with our technique of connecting monitoring nodes that experience similar traffic, is scalable and offers a good accuracy rate compared to a centralized system with full knowledge of the participating sensors? data.},

To enable touch input on a wide variety of 3D printable surfaces, we contribute two techniques for designing and printing embedded sensors of custom shape. The fabrication pipeline is technically validated by a series of experiments and practically validated by a set of example applications.

        abstract = {Predictive maintenance is a challenging task, which aims at forecasting failure of a machine or one of its components. It allows companies to utilize just-in-time maintenance procedures instead of corrective or fixed-schedule ones. In order to achieve this goal, a complex and potentially error-prone process has to be completed successfully. Based on a real-world failure prediction example originated in the railway domain, we discuss a summary of the required processing steps in order to create a sound prediction process. Starting with the initial data acquisition and data fusion of three heterogeneous sources, the train diagnostic data, the workshop records and the failure report data, we identify and elaborate on the difficulties of finding a valid ground truth for the prediction of a compressor failure, caused by the integration of manually entered and potentially erroneous data. In further steps we point out the challenges of processing event-based diagnostic data to create useful features in order to train a classifier for the prediction task. Finally, we give an outlook on the tasks we yet have to accomplish and summarize the work we have done.},

This is partly due to the fact that a large number of approaches is focused on providing theoretical bounds. However, even more recent practical approaches are not being implemented. Integrating topology control with medium access control (MAC) and routing into a standard communication stack seems to be a non-trivial challenge. Some experts even doubt real-world efficiency gains. In this paper, we present asynchronous kTC (a-kTC). It builds upon the kTC topology control approach and integrates the protocol into the standard Contiki communication stack. We report up to 16\% reduction in overall energy consumption in the testbed for many-to-one and all-to-all communication. This is the first topology control evaluation indicating real-world reductions in total energy consumption.},

Being of general nature, they suit application-specific requirements insufficiently; e.g., application-specific communication patterns may favor links that the general algorithm will remove. We suggest a new research focus called application-specific topology control and propose a methodic approach for which we provide a first exploration. First, application-specific communication patterns are expressed as overlay graphs. Then, applicationspecific requirements are specified as constraints on this overlay. Next follows the core of the method, geared toward deriving application-specific topology control algorithms. Applying the method to a data collection application with a many-to-one communication pattern, we propose two topology control algorithms. In a simulation study, we evaluate these algorithms against the existing algorithm kTC and a shortest path tree, showing that the method allows trading off general network optimization against application-specific optimization.}

        abstract = {Search overlays are distributed systems which allow to easily store and retrieve data shared across a huge number of nodes. A multitude of search overlays exist, each optimized for certain environments, application requirements, and workloads. However, in highly dynamic and heterogeneous environments, the choice of the most suitable overlay changes frequently. In this paper, we propose to execute transitions between search overlays at runtime. This approach allows for switching to the most suitable overlay depending on the requirements and the environment. We analyze how these transitions can be executed and propose multiple transition strategies which differ in their required time, their overhead, and the provided performance during the transition. For the evaluation, we exemplarily executed these transition strategies for two overlays and verified the expected performance properties of the strategies. We show that transitions between search overlays are efficiently possible and can be used to always execute the most suitable search overlay.},

        abstract = {Although smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices become increasingly popular, pen and paper continue to play an important role in mobile settings, such as note taking or creative discussions. However, information on paper documents remains static and usage practices involving sharing, researching, linking or in any other way digitally processing information on paper are hindered by the gap between the digital and physical worlds. A considerable body of research has leveraged digital pen technology in order to overcome this problem with respect to static settings, however, systematically neglecting the mobile domain.  Only recently, several approaches began exploring the mobile domain and developing initial insights into mobile pen-and-paper interaction (mPPI), e.g., to publish digital sketches, [Cowan et al., 2011], link paper and digital artifacts, [Pietrzak et al., 2012] or compose music, [Tsandilas, 2012]. However, applications designed to integrate the most common mobile tools pen, paper and mobile devices, thereby combining the benefits of both worlds in a hybrid mPPI ensemble, are hindered by the lack of supporting infrastructures and limited theoretical understanding of interaction design in the domain.  This thesis advances the field by contributing a novel infrastructural approach toward supporting mPPI. It allows applications employing digital pen technology in controlling interactive functionality while preserving mobile characteristics of pen and paper. In addition, it contributes a conceptual framework of user interaction in the domain suiting to serve as basis for novel mPPI toolkits. Such toolkits ease development of mPPI solutions by focusing on expressing interaction rather than designing user interfaces by means of rigid widget sets. As such, they provide the link between infrastructure and interaction in the domain. Lastly, this thesis presents a novel, empirically substantiated theory of interaction in hybrid mPPI ensembles. This theory informs interaction design of mPPI, ultimately allowing to develop compelling and engaging interactive systems employing this modality.}

        abstract = {The global economy and sustainability issues are driving suppliers to new operating modes. Smart grids and their smart metering systems can yield sustainable and profitable operating modes. Thus, smart grids are important enablers of economic development. However, along with benefits, smart grids bring drawbacks. Similar to other interconnected technologies, security and privacy are crucial to smart grids. Neglecting security concerns might eventually compromise, for instance, the supply of electricity, water, or gas. Neglecting privacy concerns might cause the violation of the right to privacy of customers, enable surveillance, and permit manipulation of all customers. Indeed, smart meters are becoming ubiquitous, and smart grids face unprecedented threats. Public infrastructures might be jeopardized, and citizens might be manipulated. Luckily, Privacy-Preserving Protocols (PPPs) can solve this impasse.  This work advances state-of-the-art PPPs with the development of several protocols that preserve customers? privacy secure in smart grid scenarios. Four of them are revisited and improved in this thesis. Such development culminated in the concept of Asymmetric DC-Nets (ADC-Nets){--}from ?Dining Cryptographers?{--}, which are generalizations of additive homomorphic encryption primitives. In addition, we can use such primitives to construct ADC-Nets, which are cryptographic primitives for encryption, aggregation, and decryption of aggregated data. ADC-Nets underlie secure, verifiable, efficient, and scalable protocols with low communication overhead, which are independent of trusted parties, and resistant to collusion. Furthermore, smart meters can send the minimum number of required messages directly to their supplier. Thus, they can sign their messages, and as consequence, the protocols can ensure non-repudiation and fault tolerance. The former ensures that customers cannot deny the messages of their smart meters were transmitted. The latter ensures that their supplier can detect smart meters with failure{--}in themselves or in the communication channel{--}and can run the protocols without the compromised smart meters. Moreover, ADC-Nets can enforce customers? privacy. Besides the concept and results of ADC-Nets, this thesis presents other contributions listed as follows. ? This thesis contextualizes smart metering systems in smart grids around the world and points out the needed models to have security and privacy in smart grids scenarios. Furthermore, it reviews the state of the art of privacy-enhancing technologies for smart metering systems. ? This thesis presents three scenarios that require remote and frequent measurements. In addition, it assesses the minimum requirements for PPPs. Moreover, it is shown how computations can be done over encrypted measurements. ? An algebraic and a probabilistic analysis show that PPPs cannot keep customers? privacy secure using data aggregation with a small number of customers. Counterintuitively, when the number of measurements increases, the effectiveness of PPPs also increases. The optimal effectiveness is achieved when the sum of measurements and the number of smart meters are equal. These results are independent of PPPs. ? The four selected PPPs have different interesting properties. The first protocol leads to the conjecture that it has the fastest encryption algorithm, because it requires only a ?one-way function?. The second is based on elliptic curves, and further, the encryption algorithm uses only two scalar multiplications that lead to a fast protocol. The third uses an ADC-Net and inherits its benefits. When the level of security is increased, the second and the third protocol become increasingly faster than typical solutions. The fourth follows the laws of quantum mechanics, which surprisingly implies that the smart meters do not need to store a key, but they can send messages directly to their supplier without compromising privacy. ? To compare the protocols? performance, this thesis presents simulations with millions of real-world measurements that validate the theoretical results. It is shown that the raw dataset has inconsistencies that reinforce the necessity to verify the truthfulness of the transactions. Encrypted measurements are necessary and sufficient to determine whether the computations and the measurements are correct.  Besides smart grids, several application areas can use the results of this thesis, for instance, electronic voting, reputation systems, sensor networks, electronic money, mobile sensing, multi-party computation, image processing. ADC-Nets can be used to create several protocols provided with security, privacy, verifiability, scalability, reliability, efficiency, etc.  More important than efficiency, PPPs should enforce the security of customers? privacy by means of cryptography. Considering smart grids, PPPs are paramount for suppliers, for customers, and for the proper development of society.}

P2P-based publish-subscribe is a well suited paradigm for OSN scenarios as users can publish and follow topics of interest. How- ever, anonymity in P2P-based publish-subscribe (pub-sub) has been hardly analyzed so far. Research on add-on anonymization systems such as Tor mostly focuses on large scale traffic analysis rather than malicious insiders. Therefore, we analyze colluding insider attackers in more detail that operate on the basis of timing information. For that, we model a generic anonymous pub-sub system, present an attacker model, and discuss timing attacks. We analyze these attacks by a realistic simulation model and discuss potential countermeasures. Our findings indicate that even few malicious insiders are capable to disclose a large number of participants, while an attacker using large amounts of colluding nodes achieves only minor additional improvements.},

        keywords = {Computational Trust, Trust Model},
        abstract = {Trust and trustworthiness facilitate interactions between human beings worldwide, every day. They enable the formation of friendships, making of profits and the adoption of new technologies, making life not only more pleasant, but furthering the societal development. Trust, for lack of a better word, is good. When human beings trust, they rely on the trusted party to be trustworthy, that is, literally worthy of the trust that is being placed in them. If it turns out that the trusted party is unworthy of the trust placed into it, the truster has misplaced its trust, has unwarrantedly relied and is liable to experience possibly unpleasant consequences. Human social evolution has equipped us with tools for determining another?s trustworthiness through experience, cues and observations with which we aim to minimise the risk of misplacing our trust.  Social adaptation, however, is a slow process and the cues that are helpful in real, physical environments where we can observe and hear our interlocutors are less helpful in interactions that are conducted over data networks with other humans or computers, or even between two computers. This presents a challenge in a world where the virtual and the physical intermesh increasingly. A challenge that computational trust models seek to address by applying computational evidence-based methods to estimate trustworthiness.  In this thesis, the state-of-the-art in evidence-based trust models is extended and improved upon ? in particular with regard to their statistical modelling. The statistics behind (Bayesian) trustworthiness estimation will receive special attention, their extension bringing about improvements in trustworthiness estimation that encompass the fol- lowing aspects: (i.) statistically well-founded estimators for binomial and multinomial models of trust that can accurately estimate the trustworthiness of another party and those that can express the inher- ent uncertainty of the trustworthiness estimate in a statistically meaningful way, (ii.) better integration of recommendations by third parties using advanced methods for determining the reliability of the received recommendations, (iii.) improved responsiveness to changes in the behaviour of trusted parties, and (iv.) increasing the generalisability of trust-relevant information over a set of trusted parties. Novel estimators, methods for combining recommendations and other trust- relevant information, change detectors, as well as a mapping for integrating stereotype-based trustworthiness estimates, are bundled in an improved Bayesian trust model, Multinomial CertainTrust.  Specific scientific contributions are structured into three distinct categories:  1. A Model for Trustworthiness Estimation: The statistics of trustworthiness estimation are investigated to design fully multinomial trustworthiness estimation model. Leveraging the assumptions behind the Bayesian estimation of binomial and multinomial proportions, accurate trustworthiness and certainty estimators are presented, and the integration of subjectivity via informed and non-informed Bayesian priors is discussed.  2. Methods for Trustworthiness Information Processing: Methods for facilitating trust propagation and accounting for concept drift in the behaviour of the trusted parties are introduced. All methods are applicable, by design, to both the binomial case and the multinomial case of trustworthiness estimation.  3. Further extension for trustworthiness estimation: Two methods for addressing the potential lack of direct experiences with new trustee in feedback-based trust models are presented. For one, the dedicated modelling of particular roles and the trust delegation between them is shown to be principally possible as an extension to existing feedback- based trust models. For another, a more general approach for feature-based generalisation using model-free, supervised machine-learners, is introduced.  The general properties of the trustworthiness and certainty estimators are derived formally from the basic assumptions underlying binomial and multinomial estimation problems, harnessing fundamentals of Bayesian statistics. Desired properties for the introduced certainty estimators, first postulated by Wang \& Singh, are shown to hold through formal argument. The general soundness and applicability of the proposed certainty estimators is founded on the statistical properties of interval estimation techniques discussed in the related statistics work and formally and rigorously shown there.  The core estimation system and additional methods, in their entirety constituting the Multinomial CertainTrust model, are implemented in R, along with competing methods from the related work, specifically for determining recommender trustworthiness and coping with changing behaviour through ageing. The performance of the novel methods introduced in this thesis was tested against established methods from the related work in simulations.  Methods for hardcoding indicators of trustworthiness were implemented within a multi-agent framework and shown to be functional in an agent-based simulation. Furthermore, supervised machine-learners were tested for their applicability by collecting a real-world data set of reputation data from a hotel booking site and evaluating their capabilities against this data set. The hotel data set exhibits properties, such as a high imbalance in the ratings, that appears typical of data that is generated from reputation systems, as these are also present in other data sets.},

        abstract = {Today, most smartphones feature different kinds of secure hardware such as processor-based security extensions (e.g., TrustZone) and dedicated secure co-processors, e.g., a SIM card or an embedded secure element available on NFC-enabled devices (e.g., as used by Google Wallet). Unfortunately, the available secure hardware is almost never utilized by commercial third party apps, although their usage would drastically improve the security of security critical apps. The reasons are diverse: secure hardware stakeholders such as phone manufacturers and mobile network operators (MNOs) have full control over the corresponding interfaces and expect high financial revenue; and the current code provisioning schemes are inflexible and impractical since they require developers to collaborate with secure hardware stakeholders, which is hardly affordable for typical developers of mobile apps.  In this paper we propose a new paradigm for secure hardware code provisioning. Our solution (i) allows developers to distribute security sensitive code (e.g., trusted apps or applets) as a part of the mobile app package; (ii) supports flexible and dynamic assignment of access rights to secure hardware APIs from mobile apps independently from an OS vendor and a stakeholder; (iii) enables stakeholders of secure hardware to obtain revenue for every provisioned piece of code; (iv) allows for automated and transparent installation and deinstallation of applets on demand in order to permit arbitrary number of applets, e.g., in the constraint Java card environment. Our scheme is compatible with Global Platform (GP) specifications and can be easily incorporated into existing standards. We developed a proof of concept prototype based on a Java card secure element on an Android-based smartphone and smartwatch and evaluated it by deploying a security critical application for access control.}

        abstract = {The IT infrastructure of today needs to be ready to defend against massive cyber-attacks which often originate from distributed attackers such as Botnets. Most Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), nonetheless, are still working in isolation and cannot effectively detect distributed attacks. Collaborative IDSs (CIDSs) have been proposed as a collaborative defense against the ever more sophisticated distributed attacks. However, collaboration by exchanging suspicious alarms among all interconnected sensors in CIDSs does not scale with the size of the IT infrastructure; hence, detection performance and communication overhead, required for collaboration, must be traded off. We propose to partition the set of considered sensors into subsets, or communities, as a lever for this trade off. The novelty of our approach is the application of ensemble based learning, a machine learning paradigm suitable for distributed intrusion detection. In our approach, community members exchange data features used to train models of normality, not bare alarms, thereby further reducing the communication overhead of our approach. Our experiments show that we can achieve detection rates close to those based on global information exchange with smaller subsets of collaborating sensors.},

        abstract = {Driven by advances in technology as well as standardisation efforts, the adoption of smart things gathers pace in various industries. Smart things range from simple objects being equipped with smart labels to comprehensive objects with embedded storage, computing, and networking capabilities. They aim at improving product operation and usage as well as at enabling functionality beyond their original purpose of use. Think of connected cars that seek for enhancing traffic safety and efficiency as well as for enabling telematic services, or industrial assets that sense and monitor their condition in order to improve maintenance operations. This thesis addresses smart products, a specific class of smart things that targets simplicity of product use by means of multi-modal and personalised product-to-user interaction. For this purpose, smart products are equipped with knowledge and knowledge-related functionality. Amongst others, this includes domain and problem-solving knowledge that is used to enable active user guidance.  Given their resource limitation and potential intermittent connectivity, smart products are typically not able to locally store all content required and created across their life cycle neither can they connect to remote systems at all times for storing and / or retrieving information. Yet, in order to achieve simplicity of product use, it is essential that product-to-user interaction is not distorted by long user-perceived delays for retrieving required information or by falling back to simple interaction means, because of content being not accessible. Hence, there is a need for intelligent mechanisms that make content available when required and accessible with low latency.  This thesis studies how procedural problem-solving knowledge associated with smart products can be utilised by content placement strategies, i.e., content replication and replacement strategies, to enhance content access. According to the results of the EU-funded research project SmartProducts, the thesis assumes procedural problem-solving knowledge to be modelled in the form of workflows that reflect sequences of activities and feature annotation of activity-related content needs. Also, it assumes complex-structured workflows that consist of multiple alternative branches with the actual branch(es) to be followed being determined dynamically.  On this basis, the thesis contributes three workflow-based replication strategies, namely Most Probable Path (MPP), Path Assessment (PA), and Cooperative Path Assessment (CPA). These strategies utilise workflow structures to predict and pre-replicate (i.e., replicate in advance) workflow-related content needs in order to enhance query efficiency of content requests during workflow execution. While MPP, PA, and CPA pursue the same objective, they vary in the way of balancing enhancement of query efficiency with the potential risk of false pre-replication as well as in their incorporated sphere of knowledge.  In order to address uncertainty in execution of branched workflows and the resulting risk of falsely pre-replicated content, the workflow-based replication strategies apply the proposed concept of transient replicas. Transient replicas are assigned gradually increasing Time To Live (TTL) intervals. While they may be persisted in case the number of requests exceeds a pre-defined threshold, they are removed in case they are not accessed within their active TTL. This avoids pre-replication wastage in the long term and limits the number of replicas to be maintained.  Moreover, the replication strategy Content Class (CC) is proposed. Instead of relying on observed or predicted access patterns, this approach enables smart product applications to classify their intended content use and provides content-class-specific best effort policies to improve content organisation.  Given the typical benefits of integrated content replication and replacement strategies, this thesis proposes the two replacement strategies MFR for Transient Replicas (MFRTR) and Enhanced Content Replacement (ECR) that complement the workflow-based replication strategies and CC, respectively. MFRTR extends the well-known replacement policy MFR [KRT06, KRT07] by taking into account transient replicas with lazy removal properties. Thus, transient replicas are only removed if additional storage capacity is needed for serving pending storage operations. This results in efficient utilisation of available storage capacity without increasing replacement overhead. ECR extends MFRTR by leveraging content classification for determining replacement candidates. Instead of purely relying on access frequency and recency, this approach aims at preserving location properties of content according to its classification.  The value of the proposed content placement strategies is assessed with a simulation-based evaluation study that adopts the application scenario smart aircraft manufacturing developed jointly with EADS Innovation Works. This study reveals that the proposed strategies improve overall and workflow-related query efficiency by up to 28\% and 62\%, respectively, compared to related work. As to the knowledge of the author, the proposed content placement strategies are the first that leverage procedural problem-solving knowledge associated with smart products and enable application-affected content organisation while taking into account the challenges of smart products.}

Many details about the life of customers can be inferred from fine-grained information on their energy consumption. Different from other state-of-the-art protocols, the presented protocol addresses this issue as well as the integrity of electricity bills. Therefore, our protocol provides secure aggregation of measured consumption per round of measurement and verifiable billing after any period. Aggregation of measured consumption ensures that energy suppliers know the consolidated consumption of their customers. Verifiable billing ensures fairness for customers and their energy supplier. We adapt a homomorphic encryption scheme based on elliptic curve cryptography to efficiently protect the data series of measurements that are collected by smart meters. Moreover, energy suppliers can detect and locate energy loss or fraud in the power grid while retaining the privacy of all consumers.}

However, prior research on these systems has mainly been restricted to analyzing deployed systems and suggesting improvements tailored to specific environments rather than exploiting the huge parameter space governing the routing performance. Concise analytic results are rare, due to the complexity of Kademlia?s parallel and non-deterministic lookups.   This paper introduces the first comprehensive formal model of the routing for the entire family of Kademlia-type systems. We validate our model against simulations of both the BitTorrent Mainline DHT and eMule?s KAD implementation. The model allows a highly scalable comparison with respect to the hop distribution of different variations to the original protocol. In particular, we show that several of the recent improvements to the protocol in fact have been counterproductive with regard to routing efficiency.},

The proposed solutions, however, are either impractical due to their massive coordination overhead, or of limited benefit since they cannot realize perfect coordination.  We present CoMon, an architecture for network-wide coordinated caching. CoMon realizes an affordable, yet highly effective, coordination by assigning monitoring and cache-aware (re)routing tasks to only a few nodes, through which the majority of traffic is expected or enforced to pass. CoMon, by design, can maximize the diversity of cached contents and minimize cache replacements. In addition, our simulation study using ISP topologies, shows that CoMon under a pressuring scenario, when coordinates as few as 5\% of the nodes, reduces the server hit ratio of both CCN and notable related work by up to 45\%.

However, routers and content providers in NDN can be targets for a new DDoS attack called the Interest Flooding Attack (IFA). As a consequence, affected routers drop legitimate interest packets. We argue that IFA can be defended effectively when it is detected and mitigated, at early stage, based on timely and aggregated information of exchanged packets and forwarding states. Towards this end, we adapt CoMon, a framework that we developed formerly to coordinate caching-related decisions in NDN. This choice is motivated by CoMon?s proven ability to realize efficient, yet lightweight, coordination. A preliminary evaluation confirms the effectiveness of our solution against IFAs.},

        abstract = {Mithilfe der Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) Suite k{\"o}nnen wichtige Kommunikationsdaten {\"u}ber IP-basierte Netzwerke auf sichere Art und Weise ausgetauscht werden. Diese Sicherheit st{\"u}tzt sich auf die Annahme, dass der Diffie-Hellman (DH) Schl{\"u}sselaustausch als Teil des Internet Key Exchange (IKE) Protokolls, welches unter anderem die kryptographischen Schl{\"u}ssel f{\"u}r IPsec liefert, nicht gebrochen werden kann. Ein Quantencomputer-gest{\"u}tzter Angriff kann allerdings mithilfe von Shors Algorithmus die kryptographischen Schl{\"u}ssel berechnen und somit die Sicherheit einer IPsec-Verbindung w{\"a}hrend und nach dessen Ablauf brechen. Die vorliegende Arbeit besch{\"a}ftigt sich mit der Integration sogenannter Post-Quantum Kryptographie (PQC) in IPsec zum Schutz vor Angriffen durch Quantencomputer. Dabei wurden die durch Quantencomputer gef{\"a}hrdeten Bereiche von IPsec und IKE analysiert und der DH-Schl{\"u}sselaustausch im IKE-Protokoll mit einem neuen Schl{\"u}sselaustausch basierend auf dem Niederreiter-Verfahren ersetzt. Diese Implementierung wurde anschlie{\ss}end mit aktuell verbreiteten Schl{\"u}sselaustauschverfahren verglichen. Die Ergebnisse zeigen neben einer f{\"u}r den praktischen Einsatz hohen Performanz des Niederreiter-Schl{\"u}sselaustauschs die erste funktionierende IPsec-Verbindung, die Sicherheit gegen Angriffe durch Quantencomputer bietet. Auf der anderen Seite decken sie allerdings auch die Schw{\"a}chen des Niederreiter-Verfahrens und die mangelnde Pr{\"a}senz von PQC in kryptographischen Standards auf.}

Furthermore, we contribute two tools to verify if a web service adheres to its claimed QoS described with a performance function. For this verification, claimed performance is compared with reading points gathered from spot-testing the quality of the web service. The first tool we discuss is function interpolation, the second one applies methods from computational trust.

        abstract = {Cloud computing enables information technology related services in a more dynamic and scalable way than before{--}more cost?effective than before due to the economy of scale and of sharing resources. Usually, cloud providers describe their promised behaviour{--}regarding functional and non?functional aspects of the service provision{--}by way of service level agreements (SLAs). For different providers offering similar functionality, SLAs are often insufficiently claimable and inconsistent with the aspects considered important by customers. Therefore, customers face problems identifying a trustworthy cloud provider solely on the basis of its SLA. To support customers in reliably identifying trustworthy cloud providers, we propose a multi?faceted trust management system architecture for cloud computing marketplaces and related approaches. This system provides the means for identifying trustworthy cloud providers in terms of different attributes, for example, compliance, data governance and information security. In this article, we present the first realization of our proposed trust management system using the Consensus Assessment Initiative Questionnaire, initiated by the Cloud Security Alliance, as one of the sources of trust information. In particular, our proposed approach contributes to the challenge of extracting trust information from Consensus Assessment Initiative Questionnaires completed by cloud providers. Finally, our implemented system and related approaches are experimented using real datasets.},

        abstract = {Privacy, in particular anonymity, is required to increase the acceptance of users for the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT is built upon sensors that encompass us in each step we take. Hence, they can collect sensitive, privacy-invading data that can be used to establish complete user profiles. For this reason, sensing in the IoT needs to provide means of privacy-protection. In this paper, we discuss an approach for sharing smartphone sensor data and user-generated content in a privacy-protecting manner via the Micro-blogging platform (MbP) Twitter. For that, we discuss privacy needs of users in Micro-blogging platforms (MbPs) and that privacy should not only ensure confidentiality but also anonymity. We discuss related work and systems along these requirements and conclude that anonymity is hardly considered. We introduce our construction Twitterize that integrates well with the MbP Twitter and allows users and sensors to share information normally as well as privacy-preserving with a single application. Twitterize establishes overlay networks for hashtags over Twitters? social network and neither depends on additional infrastructure nor peer-to-peer communication.}

We introduce the concept of asymmetric DC-Nets that has good property of both approaches. Moreover, we construct one protocol based on integer numbers that fulfills all requirements to be classified as an asymmetric DC-Net. Many other protocols might be constructed to fulfill these requirements. Since asymmetric DC-Nets provide privacy-preserving aggregation of time-series data with verification, they have potential to be applied to e-voting, reputation systems, sensor networks, multi-party computation, and smart grids, among others.}

        abstract = {Privacy-enhancing technologies for the Smart Grid address either the consolidation of users' energy consumption or the verification of billing information. The goal of this paper is to introduce iKUP, a protocol that addresses both problems simultaneously. iKUP is an efficient privacy-enhancing protocol based on DC-Nets and Elliptic Curve Cryptography as Commitment. It covers the entire cycle of power provisioning, consumption, billing, and verification. iKUP allows: (i) utility providers to obtain a consolidated energy consumption value that relates to the consumption of a user set, (ii) utility providers to verify the correctness of this consolidated value, and (iii) the verification of the correctness of the billing information by both utility providers and users. iKUP prevents utility providers from identifying individual contributions to the consolidated value and, therefore, protects the users' privacy. The analytical performance evaluation of iKUP is validated through simulation using as input a real-world data set with over 157 million measurements collected from 6,345 smart meters. Our results show that iKUP has a worse performance than other protocols in aggregation and decryption, which are operations that happen only once per round of measurements and, thus, have a low impact in the total protocol performance. iKUP heavily outperforms other protocols in encryption, which is the most demanded cryptographic function, has the highest impact on the overall protocol performance, and it is executed in the smart meters.}

        abstract = {Digital societies increasingly rely on secure communication between parties. Certificate enrollment protocols are used by certificate authorities to issue public key certificates to clients. Key agreement protocols, such as Diffie-Hellman, are used to compute secret keys, using public keys as input, for establishing secure communication channels. Whenever the keys are generated by clients, the bootstrap process requires either (a) an out-of-band verification for certification of keys when those are generated by the clients themselves, or (b) a trusted server to generate both the public and secret parameters. This paper presents a novel constrained key agreement protocol, built upon a constrained Diffie-Hellman, which is used to generate a secure public-private key pair, and to set up a certification environment without disclosing the private keys. In this way, the servers can guarantee that the generated key parameters are safe, and the clients do not disclose any secret information to the servers.}

Many of those networks are too large to be processed e ciently and some are not even available in their entirety. In order to reduce the size of available data or collect a sample of an existing network, several sampling algorithms were developed. They aim to produce samples whose properties are close to the original network. It is unclear what sample size is su cient to obtain a sample whose properties can be used to estimate those of the original network. This estimation requires sampling algorithms that produce results that converge smoothly to the original properties since estimations based on unsteady data are unreliable. Consequently, we eval- uate the monotonicity of sampled properties while increasing the sample size. We provide a ranking of common sampling algorithms based on their monotonicity of relevant network properties using the results from four nework classes.\&nbsp;},

        abstract = {The main contribution of this work is the construction of the Efficient Privacy-Preserving Protocol for Smart Metering Systems (EPPP4SMS), which brings together features of the best privacy-preserving protocols in the literature for smart grids. In addition, EPPP4SMS is faster on the meter side---and in the whole round (encryption, aggregation, and decryption)---than other protocols based on homomorphic encryption, and it is still scalable. Moreover, EPPP4SMS enables energy suppliers and customers to verify the billing information and measurements without leaking private information. Since the energy supplier knows the amount of generated electricity and its flow throughout electrical substations, the energy supplier can use this verification to detect energy loss and fraud. Different from verification based on digital signature, our verification enables new features, e.g., smart meters and their energy supplier can compute the verification without storing the respective encrypted measurements. Furthermore, EPPP4SMS may be suitable to many other scenarios that need aggregation of time-series data keeping privacy protected, including electronic voting, reputation systems, and sensor networks. In this paper, we present theoretical results of EPPP4SMS and their validation by implementation of algorithms and simulation using real-world measurement data. },

Since the energy supplier knows the amount of generated electricity and the consolidated consumption in a round of measurements, the energy supplier can detect energy loss and fraud. To preserve customers' privacy, we use a homomorphic commitment scheme with a homomorphic encryption scheme. All data sent from a meter to any other component in the communication network is either a commitment or an encrypted message. To provide security and privacy, we only require software modifications, leaving the hardware of the smart grid unchanged.}

        abstract = {The majority of workplaces in developed countries concern knowledge work. Accordingly, the IT industry and research made great efforts for many years to support knowledge workers -- and indeed, computer-based information workplaces have come of age. Nevertheless, knowledge work in the physical world has still quite a number of unique advantages, and the integration of physical and digital knowledge work leaves a lot to be desired. The present thesis aims at reducing these deficiencies; thereby, it leverages late technology trends, in particular interactive tabletops and resizable hand-held displays.  We start from the observation that knowledge workers develop highly efficient practices, skills, and dexterity of working with physical objects in the real world, whether content-unrelated (coffee mugs, stationery etc.) or content-related (books, notepads etc.). Among the latter, paper-based objects -- the notorious analog information bearers -- represent by far the most relevant (super-) category. We discern two kinds of practices: collective practices concern the arrangement of objects with respect to other objects and the desk, while specific practices operate on individual objects and usually alter them. The former are mainly employed for an effective management of the physical desktop workspace -- e.g., everyday objects are frequently moved on tables to optimize the desk as a workplace -- or an effective organization of paper-based documents on the desktop -- e.g., stacking, fanning out, sorting etc. The latter concern the specific manipulation of physical objects related to the task at hand, i.e. knowledge work. Widespread assimilated practices concern not only writing on, annotating, or spatially arranging paper documents but also sophisticated manipulations -- such as flipping, folding, bending, etc.   Compared to the wealth of such well-established practices in the real world, those for digital knowledge work are bound by the indirection imposed by mouse and keyboard input, where the mouse provided such a great advancement that researchers were seduced to calling its use "direct manipulation". In this light, the goal of this thesis can be rephrased as exploring novel interaction concepts for knowledge workers that i) exploit the flexible and direct manipulation potential of physical objects (as present in the real world) for more intuitive and expressive interaction with digital content, and ii) improve the integration of the physical and digital knowledge workplace. Thereby, two directions of research are pursued. Firstly, the thesis investigates the collective practices executed on the desks of knowledge workers, thereby discerning content-related (more precisely, paper-based documents) and content-unrelated object -- this part is coined as table-centric approaches and leverages the technology of interactive tabletops. Secondly, the thesis looks at specific practices executed on paper, obviously concentrating on knowledge related tasks due to the specific role of paper -- this part is coined as paper-centric approaches and leverages the affordances of paper-like displays, more precisely of resizable i.e. rollable and foldable displays.   The table-centric approach leads to the challenge of blending interactive tabletop technology with the established use of physical desktop workspaces. We first conduct an exploratory user study to investigate behavioral and usage patterns of interaction with both physical and digital documents on tabletop surfaces while performing tasks such as grouping and browsing. Based on results of the study, we contribute two sets of interaction and visualization concepts -- coined as PaperTop and ObjecTop -- that concern specific paper based practices and collective practices, respectively. Their efficiency and effectiveness are evaluated in a series of user studies.       As mentioned, the paper-centric perspective leverages late ultra-thin resizable display technology. We contribute two sets of novel interaction concepts again -- coined as FoldMe and Xpaaand -- that respond to the design space of dual-sided foldable and of rollout displays, respectively. In their design, we leverage the physical act of resizing  not "just" for adjusting the screen real estate but also for interactively performing operations. Initial user studies show a great potential for interaction with digital contents, i.e. for knowledge work. },

        abstract = {Using Peer-to-Peer technology to de- liver live video streams to mobile devices is a promis- ing approach. It allows service providers to scale their video distribution without increasing their cost. As the resources are replicated at the edge of the network, mobile devices can take advantage of close-by peers in order to get the required data faster. This, however, is challenging due to the highly dynamic nature of the participating mobile devices. Hence, the video distribution overlay needs to adapt quickly to changes in the available bandwidth as well as the location of peers. Also, it should be resilient to arbitrary disconnects as well as targeted attacks. In this pa- per, we introduce a multi-tree-push streaming system which takes the upload capacities of mobile devices into account and arranges the overlay connections based on their position in the network topology. Our demonstrations show that our system is resilient to churn and attacks while running on desktop machines and mobile devices.}

        abstract = {The research described in this work can significantly simplify and facilitate the creation and configuration of secure access control rule sets.  Access control is used to provide confidential data or information only to authorized entities and deny access otherwise. Access control mechanisms can be configured with access control rule sets that need to be created and maintained by the users or administrators.   The research commences by answering the first research question:  1. How can access control be integrated into future products?  Basic concepts are presented and integrated into a holistic design. The latter is embedded into a general framework, which was developed by an academia-industry consortium, and in which the author participated.   Questions arise regarding usability aspects of access control mechanisms. An analysis of security services in the beginning of this dissertation shows that, especially for access control mechanisms that are managed by casual users, a high level of usability is required because individual preferences of the data owner have to be taken into account.   Analysis of how the core security objectives (see Section [sec:Core-Security-Principles]) can be achieved identifies a usability gap regarding the generation and configuration of access control rule sets. Automation is not fully possible because individual preferences of users need to be considered.   Related research questions are:  2. What are the requirements for usable access control rule sets? 	 3. What are formally founded quantifiable measurements for those requirements, and how can these measurements be used to support users in generating of usable access control rule sets?  To answer these questions, a systematic analysis of expert opinions and related work was performed. The results of that analysis were grouped into categories and further refined into six informal requirements. The six informal requirements were mathematically formalized and six associated sets with respective linear metrics were derived. These formal tools are used to automatically calculate additional information about the actual access control rule set to support users in generating and optimizing the rule set properly. Two user studies were carried out to validate and evaluate the research and the findings presented in this work. They demonstrate that our metrics help users generate statistically significant better rule sets.  The dissertation concludes with an outlook and a vision for further research in usable access control rule set configuration.},

        abstract = {User input on television (TV) typically requires a mediator device such as a handheld remote control. While this is a well-established interaction paradigm, a handheld device has serious drawbacks: it can be easily misplaced due to its mobility and in case of a touch screen interface, it also requires additional visual attention. Emerging interaction paradigms such as 3D mid-air gestures using novel depth sensors (e.g. Microsoft Kinect), aim at overcoming these limitations, but are known to be tiring. In this article, we propose to leverage the palm as an interactive surface for TV remote control. We present three user studies which set the base for our four contributions: We (1) qualitatively explore the conceptual design space of the proposed imaginary palm-based remote control in an explorative study, (2) quantitatively investigate the effectiveness and accuracy of such an interface in a controlled experiment, (3) identified user acceptance in a controlled laboratory evaluation comparing PalmRC concept with two most typical existing input modalities, here conventional remote control and touch-based remote control interfaces on smart phones for their user experience, task load, as well as overall preference, and (4) contribute PalmRC, an eyes-free, palm-surface-based TV remote control. Our results show that the palm has the potential to be leveraged for device-less eyes-free TV remote interaction without any third-party mediator device.}

        abstract = {The aim and motivation of this dissertation can be best described in one of the most important application fields, the cloud computing. It has changed entire business model of service-oriented computing environments in the last decade. Cloud computing enables information technology related services in a more dynamic and scalable way than before ? more cost-effective than before due to the economy of scale and of sharing resources. These opportunities are too attractive for consumers to ignore in today?s highly competitive service environments. The way to realise these opportunities, however, is not free of obstacles. Services offered in cloud computing environments are often composed of multiple service components, which are hosted in distributed systems across the globe and managed by multiple parties. Potential consumers often feel that they lose the control over their data, due to the lack of transparent service specification and unclear security assurances in such environments. These issues encountered by the consumers boiled down to an unwillingness to depend on the service providers regarding the services they offer in the marketplaces. Therefore, consumers have to be put in a position where they can reliably assess the dependability of a service provider. At the same time, service providers have to be able to truthfully present the service-specific security capabilities. If both of these objectives can be achieved, consumers have a basis to make well-founded decisions about whether or not to depend on a particular service provider out of many alternatives.   In this thesis, computational trust mechanisms are leveraged to assess the capabilities and evaluate the dependability of service providers. These mechanisms, in the end, potentially support consumers to establish trust on service providers in distributed service environments, e.g., cloud computing. In such environments, acceptable quality of the services can be maintained if the providers possess required capabilities regarding different service-specific attributes, e.g., security, performance, compliance. As services in these environments are often composed of multiple services, subsystems and components, evaluating trustworthiness of the service providers based on the service-specific attributes is non-trivial.  In this vein, novel mechanisms are proposed for assessing and evaluating the trustworthiness of service providers considering the trustworthiness of composite services. The scientific contributions towards those novel mechanisms are summarised as follows: ? Firstly, we introduce a list of service-specific attributes, QoS+ [HRM10, HHRM12], based on a systematic and comprehensive analysis of existing literatures in the field of cloud computing security and trust. ? Secondly, a formal framework [SVRH11, RHMV11a, RHMV11b] is proposed to analyse the composite services along with their required service-specific attributes considering consumer requirements and represent them in simplified meaningful terms, i.e., Propositional Logic Terms (PLTs). ? Thirdly, a novel trust evaluation framework CertainLogic [RHMV11a, RHMV11b, HRHM12a, HRHM12b] is proposed to evaluate the PLTs, i.e., capabilities of service providers. The framework provides computational operators to evaluate the PLTs, considering that uncertain and conflicting information are associated with each of the PLTs and those information can be derived from multiple sources. ? Finally, harnessing these technical building blocks we present a novel trust management architecture [HRM11] for cloud computing marketplaces. The architecture is designed to support consumers in assessing and evaluating the trustworthiness of service providers based on the published information about their services.  The novel contributions of this thesis are evaluated using proof-of-concept-system, prototype implementations and formal proofs. The proof-of-concept-system [HRMV13, HVM13a, HVM13b] is a realisation of the proposed architecture for trust management in cloud marketplaces. The realisation of the system is implemented based on a self-assessment framework, proposed by the Cloud Security Alliance, where the formal framework and computational operators of CertainLogic are applied. The realisation of the system enables consumers to evaluate the trustworthiness of service providers based on their published datasets in the CSA STAR. A number of experiments are conducted in different cloud computing scenarios leveraging the datasets in order to demonstrate the technical feasibility of the contributions made in this thesis. Additionally, the prototype implementations of CertainLogic framework provide means to demonstrate the characteristics of the computational operators by means of various examples. The formal framework as well as computational operators of CertainLogic are validated against desirable mathematical properties, which are supported by formal algebraic proofs.},

        abstract = {Botnets are a serious threat to Internet-based services and end users. The recent paradigm shift from centralized to more sophisticated Peer-to-Peer (P2P)-based botnets introduces new challenges for security researchers. Centralized botnets can be easily monitored, and once their command and control server is identified, easily be taken down. However, P2P-based botnets are much more resilient against such attempts. To make it worse, botnets like P2P Zeus include additional countermeasures to make monitoring and crawling more difficult for the defenders. In this paper, we discuss in detail the problems of P2P botnet monitoring. As our main contribution, we introduce the Less Invasive Crawling Algorithm (LICA) for efficiently crawling unstructured P2P botnets and utilize only local information. We compare the performance of LICA with other known crawling methods such as Depth-first and Breadth- first search.

By naming, routing, and forwarding content instead of machine addresses, the ICN shift the protagonists at the network layer from hosts to contents. One implication is the in-network cache, which allows a better use of communication channels and faster delivery of content to the user. However, the ability to receive content from caches generates concerns about access control. In this context, we propose a solution for access control in ICN based on proxy re-encryption. The proposed solution ensures that only authorized users are able to access content, while maintaining the beneficial effects of caching in ICN, even in face of malicious entities.}

        abstract = {Envision the future disaster recovery worker relying on mobile devices to work in a disaster setting. This recovery worker requires and benefits from a great number of provided services, for instance, to navigate, communicate, and map the environment. However, he faces adverse networking and computing conditions, characterized by the obstructed or destroyed geographical region, the overloaded or destroyed communication infrastructure, and the density and movement of involved recovery workers. We call such surroundings harsh environments.  The present thesis strives to enable recovery workers to consume versatile (cloud) services on top of a resilient communication infrastructure. A service is a software component, i.e., an application, that provides a distinct functionality to accessing users. Thereby, three key challenges have to be faced that also define the three fields of research: (1) improving the resilience of the communication infrastructure, (2) designing a system capable of service provision, and (3) conceiving detailed simulation models and tools to investigate such systems in harsh environments. In each field of research, we contribute and evaluate novel approaches that work together to achieve the main goal of this thesis: mobile service provision in harsh environments.  First, we contribute CityMesh, a resilient emergency communication infrastructure created by interconnecting wireless routers from private households and public institutions found in urban areas. The resulting decentralized mesh network is based on the IEEE 802.11 WLAN standard and outperforms the existing TETRA standard in terms of data throughput, openness, and failure resilience. Furthermore, we present our research methodology to evaluate the feasibility of our concept by collecting data about wireless routers, enhancing the data accuracy using multilateration, and constructing and analyzing CityMesh networks. We show that network topologies in five selected cities rely on router locations specific to the respective city. Furthermore, we demonstrate that private routers are crucial to create a resilient CityMesh network. To realize the CityMesh concept, we propose to install an emergency switch into wireless routers. This switch could be triggered by eligible authorities in case of a disaster.  Second, we present the core contribution of our thesis: the peer-to-peer service overlay concept that fulfills the requirements of harsh environments. To ensure high quality service consumption, the most crucial system components are service discovery (enables service consumers to access a requested service) and service placement (relocates a service in the network topology to increase service quality). Based on simulations, we demonstrate that our conceived hop count placement approach outperforms the state of the art placement approach in terms of consistent service quality for all service consumers. Furthermore, we show that latency is not a suitable quality metric for service placement. We also demonstrate that three state of the art service discovery approaches designed for mobile ad-hoc networks are not capable of handling service mobility introduced by service placement. Moreover, a naive request flooding approach performs best in terms of discovery performance and data traffic efficiency when exposed to peer mobility and frequent service migrations. Finally, we present our real-world experiment setup PeerMoS and contribute four concepts for smooth and efficient service migration.  Third, we contribute our integrated simulation framework DisVis to investigate the effectiveness of communication systems in realistic harsh environments. Especially in disaster recovery scenarios, the movement of recovery workers depends on the terrain, the current disaster situation, the mission strategy of respective recovery workers, and the orders received from the command centers. Hence, DisVis builds upon an OpenStreetMap-based world model and a fine-grained agent-based mobility and communication model. We adjust the rule sets and parameters of our models with results from our survey targeted at experts from first response departments. As opposed to other state of the art mobility simulators, DisVis provides an online interface to connect our framework with state of the art network simulators, such as PeerfactSim.KOM. }

           title = {Mining User-Generated Content for Incidents},
        abstract = {Social media changed human interaction by allowing people to connect to each other anytime and from anywhere, resulting in many valuable information shared about a variety of different domains. Because of the large amount of data created every day, social media analytics became an important topic to make use of this source of information. Most importantly, people contribute much valuable information about crisis events such as small-scale incidents, which is currently not taken into account by decision makers in emergency management. Reasons for this are the sheer amount of information as well as the heterogeneous and unstructured nature of the data, which hinder the use of this source of information.   In this dissertation, we try to answer the question 'How can user-generated content be made a usable and valuable source of information for situational awareness of decision makers?'. To answer this question, we present a framework consisting of the necessary steps to process a large amount of social media data in such a way that incident-related information is identified and aggregated to distinct incident clusters, each one containing information about an individual real-world incident. With the contributions presented in this dissertation, previously not usable user-generated content becomes a valuable source for decision making in emergency management.  In the first part of the dissertation, we introduce the requirements of a system for small-scale incident detection, which are derived from the (1) spatial, (2) temporal, and (3) thematic dimensions defining an incident. Based on these dimensions, we develop a framework for processing a large amount of user-generated content. As a first step of the framework, we introduce how user-generated content is collected to create an initial information base, which is processed in the subsequent steps of the framework.  In the second part, we introduce several steps to preprocess unstructured social media data so it can be used in the subsequent steps of the framework. We show how named entities and temporal expressions are identified and extracted so that they can be used as additional information when creating a machine learning model that is generalizable for data that stems from a different city. We introduce a set of adaptations applied to standard techniques that allow us to extract named entities and temporal expressions from unstructured text. We also present how we make use of the temporal expressions to infer the point in time when an incident occurred. 	 In that part, we also deal with the problem of how to infer the spatial dimensions of user-generated content. We contribute a novel approach for the geolocalization of tweets that is capable of inferring the home location of a Twitter user, the point of origin where a tweet was sent, as well as of inferring the location focus of a tweet message. We show that the approach is able to locate 92\% of all tweets with a median accuracy of below 30km, thus outperforming related approaches. Furthermore, it predicts the user's residence with a median accuracy of below 5.1km. Finally, the same approach is able to estimate the focus of incident-related tweets within a median accuracy of below 250m. 	 In the third part of the dissertation, we present approaches for inferring the thematic dimension. We contribute a general approach for applying crowdsourcing to manually classify and aggregate user-generated content according to the information need of the command staff in emergency management. With this approach, we are able to differentiate incident-related information from information not related to an incident. Evaluation results with end users show that this approach is indeed valuable for the command staff. 	 As crowdsourcing is limited when it comes to the timely filtering of a large amount of information, we further contribute an approach for automatically detecting incident-related information in user-generated content. Based on an extensive evaluation of different feature groups, we present a highly precise machine learning approach that is able to classify the incident type with an F-measure of more than 90\%. We also deal with the dynamism and regional variation of user-generated content and contribute a concept that allows creating features that are not city-specific and support training a generalized model. 	 Based on the temporal, spatial, and thematic dimensions of each information item, we present a clustering approach that is able to detect incidents in a large amount of social media data. The approach clusters all information related to the same incident. Furthermore, it is able to cope with different organizational incident type vocabularies. Evaluation results show that the approach is able to detect more than 50\% of real-world incidents published in an official emergency management system. Furthermore, 32.14\% of the detected incidents are within a 500m radius and within a 10min time interval of the real-world incident, allowing precise spatial and temporal localization. With this recall, we outperform related approaches, which only detect about 5\% of the real-world incidents. Also, more than 77\% of the incident clusters created with our approach are indeed related to incidents, thus significantly reducing the quantity of irrelevant information. Furthermore, we underline the importance of incident-related tweets by conducting a user study of situational information shared in user-generated content, showing that valuable situational information is indeed shared in social media. 	 Finally, we contribute an approach for reducing labeling costs of user-generated content. The presented algorithms make use of temporal, spatial, and thematic metadata to determine the most valuable instances to label. Our evaluation shows that the approach outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, we show that labeling costs can indeed be reduced.},

Showing a number of stars, for example, is a well-known practice in e-commerce applications to communicate the quality of a product or service. Many products or services also have their quality {--} in terms of trustworthiness {--} described along more than one dimension, so that not only an overall trust score has to be communicated, but multiple scores, one for each dimension. Current visualisations of such a multicriterial trustworthiness are often based on the display of multiple individual star-like interfaces {--} a practice that offers room for improvement with regard to intuitive understanding of the displayed trust information. In this paper, we present T-Viz, a trust visualisation based on radar plots and pie charts. T-Viz concurrently shows multiple trust scores, one for each dimension, along with an aggregated trust score. Moreover, T-Viz also shows a reliability measure for every trust score graphically, in the form of a certainty score. The evaluation results from a pilot study with eleven participants indicate that T-Viz is an intuitive, comprehensible and clear interface. It succeeds at visualising and communicating multicriterial trust scores under uncertainty in one, easy to understand, graphical representation.}

        abstract = {Mobile devices and new communication technologies gain ever more importance. Evaluating such technologies for critical domains, like disaster recovery, is a difficult task and is usually done by using simulations. Until today, research focused on the impact of mobility patterns on the investigated communication technology. We argue that the influence of the communication technology on the mobility patterns is also important to produce realistic simulations and meaningful results. In this paper, we present our agent-based mobility model and our simulation framework. This framework can be connected to a network simulator to execute mobility and network simulations in parallel, thus, influencing each other. The evaluation of our mobility model with real world experts in the field of disaster recovery indicated our approach to be accurate and also revealed potential for improvements.},

        abstract = {In recent years, the number of sophisticated cyber attacks has increased rapidly. At the same time, people tend to utilize unknown, in terms of trustworthiness, wireless net- works in their daily life. They connect to these networks, e.g., airports, without knowledge of whether they are safe or infected with actively propagating malware. In traditional networks, malicious behavior can be detected via Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). However, IDSs cannot be applied easily to mobile environments and to resource constrained devices. Another common defense mechanism is honeypots, i.e., systems that pretend to be an attractive target to at- tract malware and attackers. As a honeypot has no pro- ductive use, each attempt to access it can be interpreted as an attack. Hence, they can provide an early indication on malicious network environments. Since low interaction honeypots do not demand high CPU or memory require- ments, they are suitable to resource constrained devices like smartphones or tablets. In this paper we present the idea of Honeypot-To-Go. We envision portable honeypots on mobile devices that aim on the fast detection of malicious networks and thus boost the security awareness of users. Moreover, to demonstrate the feasibility of this proposal we present our prototype HosTaGe, a low-interaction honeypot implemented for the Android OS. We present some initial results regarding the performance of this application as well as its ability to de- tect attacks in a realistic environment. To the best of our knowledge, HosTaGe is the first implementation of a generic low-interaction honeypot for mobile devices. }

        abstract = {Mobile media sharing is an increasingly popular form of social media interaction. Research has shown that asynchronous sharing fosters and maintains social connections and serves as a memory aid. More recently, researchers have investigated the potential for mobile media sharing as a mechanism for providing additional event-related information to spectators in a stadium. In this paper, we describe CoStream, a novel system for mobile live sharing of user-generated video in-situ during events. Developed iteratively with users, CoStream goes beyond prior work by providing a strong real-time coupling to the event, leveraging users? social connections to provide multiple perspectives on the ongoing action. Field trials demonstrate that real time sharing of different perspectives on the same event has the potential to provide fundamentally new experiences of same-place events, such as concerts or stadium sports. We discuss how CoStream enriches social interactions, increases context, social and spatial awareness, and thus encourages active spectatorship. We further contribute key requirements for the design of future interfaces supporting the co-construction of shared experiences during events, in-situ. }

        abstract = {Peer-to-Peer (P2P) streaming has been a scalable and cost-efficient solution to deliver live video streams. To reduce the bandwidth demands at video servers, it uses resources (mostly upload bandwidths) of participating peers. However, depending on unreliable end-hosts to build an efficient and robust streaming system is a difficult task. Various approaches have been proposed. They are often classified by the type of overlay topologies and the way video packets are disseminated in the overlay.  Single-tree-push systems have low latency, but are less resilient to network dynamics. Mesh-pull systems are more resilient to failure and churn, but suffer larger delays and overhead. Hybrid systems are based on a mesh-pull system. Peers in these systems may switch between pull and push modes to deliver video packets at certain conditions. However, their resistance against Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks is unknown. Multi-tree-push systems split the video stream into stripes, and deliver them using disjoint trees. The latency is therefore low, which is suitable for a live streaming service. Moreover, it is also proven resilient against DoS attacks via formal analysis and simulations. Nonetheless, it is not known how the system performs in real world conditions.   A deployable P2P live streaming system that is based on the multi-tree-push approach would help shed light to this question. Moreover, this can help us to obtain more realistic estimations on latency, understand how the system behaves in an Internet-wide deployment, and have practical insights on the implementation obstacles which were abstracted in the simulation. The task, however, is not straight-forward. On one hand, the system has to be comprehensive to cope with various sophisticated situation on real-world networks. On the other hand, it should not couple tightly to a specific class of devices.  Our main contribution in this work is a deployable multi-tree-push system for P2P-based live streaming. It runs on both desktop PCs and Android-based mobile devices. Additionally, it provides controlling, monitoring, and measurement functionalities which help with debugging in the development phase, visualize the topology during a demonstration, and support the deployment of test scenarios in a distributed setting. Besides, the generic architecture of the system also allows for the extension to other classes of streaming systems.}

Particularly, the smart energy grid as large ICS and critical infrastructure, requires especial protection as the consequences of its failure can be severe. However, even a careful system design cannot prevent all attacks in advance. For this reason, the smart grid requires an additional line of defence that can be provided by a Collaborative Intrusion Detection System (CIDS) to detect unknown and ongoing attacks. In this paper, we describe the requirements to a CIDS for deployment in the smart grid. Furthermore, we discuss the design choices for such a system and summarize the arising challenges in the deployment of CIDSs in smart grids as well as present initial ideas to address them.},

The goal of this paper is to provide means for obtaining usable access control rule sets, which we define as rule sets that (i) reect the access control policy and (ii) are easy to understand and manage. In this paper, we formally define the challenges that users face when generating usable access control rule sets and provide formal tools to handle them more easily. We started our research with a pilot study in which specialists were interviewed. The objective was to list usability challenges regarding the management of access control rule sets and verify how those challenges were handled by specialists. The results of the pilot study were compared and combined with results from related work and refined into six novel, formally defined metrics that are used to measure the security and usability aspects of access control rule sets. We validated our findings with two user studies, which demonstrate that our metrics help users generate statistically significant better rule sets.},

        abstract = {Trustworthy selection of cloud services has become a significant issue in emerging cloud marketplaces. As a consequence, the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) has formulated a self-assessment framework for cloud providers to publish their cloud platform's security controls and capabilities. This framework enables consumers to select a cloud service based on the capabilities and controls published by the providers. However, a fundamental question that arises is, how can consumers trust that the security controls are satisfied as claimed by the providers and are compliant with consumers' requirements. This paper proposes a trust-aware framework to verify and evaluate these security controls considering consumers' requirements. First, we model the security controls in the form of trust properties. Then, we introduce a taxonomy of these properties based on their semantics and identify the authorities who can validate the properties. The taxonomy of these properties is the basis of trust formalisation in our proposed framework. The framework rests on the notion of hybrid trust that combines hard and soft trust mechanisms for verifying the trust properties. Furthermore, a decision model is proposed as an integral part of the framework in order to empower consumers to determine trustworthiness of cloud providers. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed trust-aware security evaluation framework could be potentially useful in practice for consumers to determine trustworthy cloud providers in a competitive marketplace},

        abstract = {State-of-the art trust and reputation systems seek to apply machine learning methods to overcome generalizability issues of experience-based Bayesian trust assessment. These approaches are, however, often model-centric instead of focussing on data and the complex adaptive system that is driven by reputation-based service selection. This entails the risk of unrealistic model assumptions. We outline the requirements for robust probabilistic trust assessment using supervised learning and apply a selection of estimators to a real-world data set, in order to show the effectiveness of supervised methods. Furthermore, we provide a representational mapping of estimator output to a belief logic representation for the modular integration of supervised methods with other trust assessment methodologies.}

           month = {Mai},
        language = {en},
            year = {2013},
        abstract = {In industrial and post industrial nations like Germany and the USA more than a quarter of the workforce mainly works with information. Most of the work done by these information workers is the production, supervision and dissemination of information at computer workplaces. Information workers frequently works on multiple tasks in parallel. Few guidelines regulate and structure the work process. Therefore, the successful execution of the work requires a high degree of individual planning.  A common effect of ad-hoc executions of multiple tasks are memory failures: Planned activities are forgotten (prospective memory failures), or the recall of work processes' status and involved information objects fails (retrospective memory failures). The computer---a multitasking machine---even increases the likelihood of memory failures due to an increased number of activities executed in parallel. This dissertation investigates methods to decrease the likelihood of memory failures in information work at the computer workplace. The effort leads to the design of a tool that provides support for information work based on externalized activity data. This document is structured as follows: 1)The first part investigates information work from the perspectives of psychology, organization theory and sociology. Identified characteristics of information work relevant for this dissertation are captured in an ideal type. This includes the specification of the information work process at the computer workplace as being coordinated by interruptions and as being composed of logical units of work, so called knowledge actions and desktop operations.   2) The second part proposes a system design method which facilitates the analysis of work processes that can be typically observed in information work. The method seamlessly integrates into the user-centred design method. Work is modeled and analyzed in terms of so called activity system models based on activity theory and action regulation theory. System model and analysis realize two important elements of the user-centred design method: the context of use analysis and the requirement specification. The specified method is applied to the domain of information work, resulting in requirements for a tool to decrease the likelihood of memory failures in information work. 3) The third part develops methods to address memory failures in information work based on activity data. The developed methods address the requirements previously identified by applying the system design method (part 2) to the identified ideal type (part 1). The methods are implemented and evaluated in a demonstrator:  a) Activity Data:  A fundamental contribution to address memory failures is the collection of information about the work process. To realize this, methods to capture, analyze and organize interaction histories are developed. A core element of the process is activity mining, which is a method to identify activities in interaction histories even if the activities were interrupted during the execution process. Activity mining is modeled as a clustering problem. The proposed activity mining methods show better results than the state of the art with respect to the identification of activities.  Furthermore, the proposed activity mining methods extract more details about the work execution process than the state of the art. b) Methods to Address Memory Failures: 	 Based on the extracted activity data the goal of this work is realized---support methods to address memory failures at the computer workplace are developed. A support method design space to address memory failures is created. The design space is structured along three support directions (exploration, organization, recommendation). For each support direction, a respective user support method has been designed: 1) Activity-centric task management, which leverages activity data to facilitate task management and to support the recall of ongoing activities and respective work processes. 2) An interactive activity history, which enables the exploration of activity data in a work history visualization to support the recall of earlier work processes. 3) A recommender system, which analyzes the most recent work activities of the user to propose useful information objects like emails, files and websites. The system can be configured to support for more multitasking oriented or for more focused work.  c) Transparency Tool:  The support methods have been implemented in a demonstrator named Transparency. Using the demonstrator an evaluation of the support methods with a focus on memory support was conducted. The evaluation results indicate that the support methods decrease the likelihood of prospective and retrospective memory failures for information work at the computer workplace. The scientific contributions of this dissertation address two domains. On the one hand, information work support. Methods are developed which decrease the likelihood of prospective and retrospective memory failures based on activity data. On the other hand, system design methods. A method is introduced to design systems for work types which involve a high degree of individual planning. },

The central idea behind EarPut is to go beyond prior work by unobtrusively augmenting a variety of accessories that are worn behind the ear, such as headsets or glasses. Results from a controlled experiment with 27 participants provide empirical evidence that people are able to target salient regions on their ear effectively and precisely. Moreover, we contribute a first, systematically derived interaction design space for ear-based interaction and a set of exemplary applications.}

Therefore, prior experiences, user ratings, recommendations and similar information is used. Providers of composite services assess the performance of the composite considering the performance of its components. Updating knowledge about the performance of component services based on the composite rating eventually allows to identify and replace component services that perform lower than expected. Two new approaches that integrate inter-component ratings and performance certificates issued by third-parties are proposed. Preliminary comparison with existing approaches that focus on customer ratings indicates that these two additional instruments help in correctly identifying low-performing component services.},

Although both experiences concern the same event, they are fundamentally different. In addition, communication between these two ?spectating realms? is rather cumbersome, preventing spectators to co-experience events over a distance. In this paper, we contribute a system aiming at bridging this gap by establishing a two-way communication channel between the two realms through sharing user-generated mobile live video. We describe implementation details, depict salient interaction techniques and conclude with promising research directions.},

However, these devices pose new challenges for interaction design ? in particular because of parallel multi-user interaction. In this paper, we present coBPM, a system for collaborative modeling on large touchscreens, and four multi-user interaction techniques that we coherently integrated into it. Using a set of typical modeling tasks, we provide a first evaluation of their effects on working styles, ease of use, teamwork- and output quality. We conclude with a summary of our findings on involving non-expert modelers in actual modeling, and design implications for collaborative modeling tools.},

It has been shown that geographic information systems can improve the efficiency of disaster management operations. However, workstation-based solutions fail to offer the same ease of collaboration as the large analog maps currently in use. Recent research prototypes, which use interactive tabletops for this purpose, often do not consider individual roles and the need for accountability of actions. In this paper, we present coMAP, a system built for interactive tabletops that facilitates collaborative situation analysis and planning in crisis management teams. Users can interact with coMAP using multi-touch as well as pen input. The latter is realized by new methods for the use of Anoto digital pens without the Anoto microdot pattern. A pen-optimized pie menu provides access to role-specific information and system functions. A combination of role-based access control and indoor tracking via Bluetooth is used to support accountability of actions while still allowing collaboration and information sharing. Initial user feedback on our system, collected in two focus group sessions, shows promising trends.},

The framework as it stands does not allow consumers to specify and check their own requirements, nor does it contain any means for verifying the capabilities claimed by the providers. From a customer perspective, both these aspects are essential for evaluating the trustworthiness of cloud providers and for making an informed decision. We propose a novel concept for verifying the capabilities captured in the CSA's framework, plus a decision model that checks consumer requirements against the verification results. Our capability verification combines hard trust based on rigid validation with soft trust based on evidence about past behaviour. Elaborate formal methods are applied in both fields and combined into a single concept.}

If so, users may not be aware of discussions happening on one site and are uncertain where to post their contributions. Therefore, there is a need for integrating different discussion sites. However, the integration is difficult due to different data formats. In this paper, an approach is presented that makes use of ontologies and enterprise integration patterns for seamlessly integrating discussion sites. Further, it is shown how discussions can be easily integrated with lecture recordings on a data level, and be stored for later reuse by using Semantic Web technologies and Linked Data principles.},

        abstract = {In this paper, we address the challenges of occlusion created by physical objects on interactive tabletops. We contribute an integrated set of interaction techniques designed to cope with the physical occlusion problem as well as facilitate organizing objects in hybrid settings. These techniques are implemented in ObjecTop, a system to support tabletop display applications involving both physical and virtual objects. We compile design requirements for occlusion-aware tabletop systems and conduct the first in-depth user study comparing ObjecTop with conventional tabletop interfaces in search and layout tasks. The empirical results show that occlusion-aware techniques outperform the conventional tabletop interface. Furthermore, our findings indicate that physical properties of occluders dramatically influence which strategy users employ to cope with occlusion. We conclude with a set of design implications derived from the study.},

        abstract = {Co-located meetings, as a fundamental part of our professional and educational lives heavily rely on visual information. In such meetings visual information consists of a) the artifact or ?content? part (as for instance in brainstorming meetings the mind maps) and b) of nonverbal communication elements (like deictic gestures and gazes). Blind persons to a large extent do not have access to these important aspects of information and communication which are only available via the visual channel. Personal support is considered to be the only viable solution, but can only be made available in exceptional cases. This puts blind people at a disadvantage. This paper presents first research results focusing on tracking, analyzing and representing non-visual information and communication elements to blind people to allow more independent access and participation in communication. We present a general system architecture as well as a prototype implementation presenting visual information also to blind users, so that the information gap between sighted and blind participants is reduced in co-located meetings. These activities form the basis for our future research activities on access to non-verbal communication for blind people.},

In this paper we contribute PeriTop, an interactive back-projected tabletop system which exploit the surface of physical objects and tabletop rims as additional interactive displays to represent and interact with digital objects. This is realized by augmenting the tabletop system with an inexpensive pico projector-depth camera pair. We support the PeriTop approach by depicting several salient use case scenarios aiding users in performing activities on hybrid physical-digital tabletop settings.}

        abstract = {The proliferation of mobile devices such as the Apple iPhone entails ubiquitous availability of a variety of multimedia information to users on the move; ready at our fingertips, virtually anywhere and anytime. However, these devices have strong limitations: small screen real estate and restricted input capabilities. Moreover, with the ever increasing number of multimedia data and services, the navigation complexity rises and in turn decreases both user experience and usability. This thesis explores how the affordances of mobile devices can be leveraged to design novel interfaces for the mobile interaction with large multimedia information spaces, toward a more usable and enjoyable user experience. The contributions are placed alongside three main research directions:  The first, device-centric interaction, investigates how mobile devices can be used efficiently in spite of the small screen leveraging input modalities such as touch or tilt. It focuses on mobile video browsing as a guiding scenario and contributes an exploration of the design space of mobile video browsers. It further contributes a set of novel interfaces, which are analyzed in an extensive controlled experiment. To state only one example, our analysis shows that the video player included in the iPhone has significant drawbacks; it also points out how future versions can be designed to be more usable.  The second research direction, space-centric interaction, pushes the boundaries of the virtual information space beyond the small screen toward the physical environment. It particularly looks at how mobile devices can be used as see-through displays when mapping the virtual information to the physical space. It also contributes an empirically grounded theory thereof and a novel movement time model for the embodied navigation with spatially-aware displays.  The third axis of research is devoted to the questions of how virtual and physical space can be tightly integrated, allowing for both device- and space-centric interaction with real-world objects--not just one particular mobile device. Pico projectors are used to project virtual information into physical space, turning objects into dedicated projection surfaces and tangible interaction devices. The thesis investigates this in an exploratory field study. Based upon this study, it advances the field of pico projector interaction by deriving novel interaction techniques. Results from a user study indicate the potential to fundamentally change how we ubiquitously interact with augmented real-world objects.}

We propose to use them as ?light beams?: Everyday objects sojourning in a beam are turned into dedicated projection surfaces and tangible interaction devices. This way, our daily surroundings get populated with interactive objects, each one temporarily chartered with a dedicated sub-issue of pervasive interaction. While interaction with objects has been studied in larger, immersive projection spaces, the affordances of pico projections are fundamentally different: they have a very small, strictly limited field of projection, and they are mobile. This paper contributes the results of an exploratory field study on how people interact with everyday objects in pico projections in nomadic settings. Based upon these results, we present novel interaction techniques that leverage the limited field of projection and trade-off between digitally augmented and traditional uses of everyday objects.},

Such protocols provide sender-anonymity for the real-time information, while consolidated data is sent for billing. In this work, the privacy properties of such protocols are analyzed, and their computational efficiency is evaluated and compared using simulation to other solutions based on homomorphic encryption.}

In contrast to sense-making of paper documents, where physical structuring of many documents has proven to be key to effective work, interaction with video is still restricted to the traditional \&quot;one video at a time\&quot; paradigm. This paper investigates how interaction with video can benefit from paper-like displays that allow for working with multiple videos simultaneously in physical space. We present a corresponding approach and system called PaperVideo, including novel interaction concepts for both video and audio. These include spatial techniques for temporal navigation, arranging, grouping and linking of videos, as well as for managing video contents and simultaneous audio playback on multiple displays. An evaluation with users provides insights into how paper-based navigation with videos improves active video work.},

To make contextualized security interventions feasible, we need to support developers in selecting the relevant factors for their applications and support them in deriving the appropriate intervention strategy and content. In this paper, we propose a security intervention framework and methodology which provides such a support.}

        abstract = {Topology control for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) is a frequently tackled challenge, for which no satisfying general solution for realistic deployments has been found to the current day. Aiding to minimize unnecessary transmissions, it nevertheless represents a crucial function of WSN, in the light of their pursuit of efficiency. kTC is a new WSN topology control that unlike prior art neither relies on location information, nor on complex geometric structures, which could leave doubts about a practical feasibility. Even though location-free approaches have been proposed to circumvent systematic problems, they do not address issues like robustness and adaptability satisfyingly, which may lead to disconnection in real world deployments. kTC is a locationfree approach that adapts topologies dynamically in face of changing environmental influences. It is based on a local, patternbased heuristic, and transmitting only two messages per node to construct the topology it is highly scalable. The graphs kTC creates are symmetric, connected, and planar; they have bounded degree and nodes are off-separated. Simulative evaluations indicate that kTC outperforms known topology control schemes. A preliminary deployment on a sensor testbed corroborates the obtained results and acts as proof of concept for kTC.},

The growing market penetration, with an evermore diverse provider and service landscape, turns Cloud computing marketplaces a highly competitive one. In this highly competitive and distributed service environment, the assurances are insufficient for the consumers to identify the dependable and trustworthy Cloud providers. This paper provides a landscape and discusses incentives and hindrances to adopt Cloud computing from Cloud consumers? perspective. Due to these hindrances, potential consumers are not sure whether they can trust the Cloud providers in offering dependable services. Trust-aided unified evaluation framework by leveraging trust and reputation systems can be used to assess trustworthiness (or dependability) of Cloud providers. Hence, cloud-related specific parameters (QoS + ) are required for the trust and reputation systems in Cloud environments. We identify the essential properties and corresponding research challenges to integrate the QoS + parameters into trust and reputation systems. Finally, we survey and analyse the existing trust and reputation systems in various application domains, characterizing their individual strengths and weaknesses. Our work contributes to understanding 1) why trust establishment is important in the Cloud computing landscape, 2) how trust can act as a facilitator in this context and 3) what are the exact requirements for trust and reputation models (or systems) to support the consumers in establishing trust on Cloud providers.},

Unfortunately the communication technology used by first responders today does not scale well. Also most of the given infrastructure, such as cell towers, might be destroyed. In recent research ad-hoc and peer-to-peer based communication has been proposed to solve the problem of resilient communication. Most mobile devices are equipped with wireless transceivers that make them suitable to participate in ad-hoc networks. But node density might be too small for a connected topology. In this paper we, therefore, discuss the implications of an emergency switch for privately owned wireless routers. Wireless routers can transition to an emergency mode to create a supportive wireless mesh network. To analyze if such a network would be beneficial and give a resilient topology real data from wireless routers in a city is gathered. We calculate the locations of these routers from GPS traces and the resulting topologies are analyzed investigating suitability and resiliency issues.},

        abstract = {Die stetig wachsende Zahl von mobilen Endger{\"a}ten und Konzepte wie "Designing for Peak Experience", f{\"u}hrt unweigerlich zu einem Streben nach Anwendungen, welche f{\"u}r immer mehr verschiedene Nutzungskontexte Benutzerschnittstellen (UIs) bereitstellen. Die Nutzungskontexte unterscheiden sich in Bezug auf Plattformen und Ger{\"a}te, Benutzergruppen und deren Ziele, sowie Randbedingungen wie z.B. die Umgebung w{\"a}hrend der Interaktion. Diese Dissertation stellt Konzepte bereit, welche den Entwickler bei der Erstellung solcher Multi-Benutzerschnittstellen (MBS) unterst{\"u}tzen und die Ausf{\"u}hrung dieser erm{\"o}glichen. Dabei liegt ein erster wesentlicher Beitrag der vorliegenden Arbeit in der Begriffsbildung und Erhebung von Anforderungen, wobei sie weit {\"u}ber verwandte Arbeiten hinausgeht. Begriffe der Problem- sowie der L{\"o}sungsdom{\"a}ne wurden im Kontext der verwandten Arbeiten untersucht; dabei wurden Inkonsistenzen festgestellt, insbesondere im Zusammenhang mit den Begriffen "Konkrete Benutzerschnittstelle (CUI)" und "Abstrakte Benutzerschnittstelle (AUI)". Diese Erkenntnisse hatten wesentlichen Einfluss auf die in dieser Arbeit entwickelten Konzepte. Insbesondere wurde die herk{\"o}mmliche Dichotomie zwischen AUI und CUI aufgehoben und durch eine beliebige Zahl von Stufen zunehmend konkreter Beschreibungen von Benutzerschnittstellen ersetzt. Diese Neuerung pr{\"a}gt die vorliegende Arbeit und schl{\"a}gt sich im Begriff der "Abstraktionsunabh{\"a}ngigen Benutzerschnittstelle (UUI)" nieder. Entsprechend den Anforderungen wurde ein Konzept entwickelt, welches aus i) einem Architekturmuster f{\"u}r MBS, ii) einer dom{\"a}nenspezifischen Sprache zur Beschreibung von MBS und iii) interaktiven sowie explorativen Unterst{\"u}tzungskonzepten besteht. Hierbei werden Modellierungstechniken f{\"u}r die UI-Struktur (bei z.B. grafischen UIs das Layout) mit Programmiertechniken f{\"u}r das UI-Verhalten verkn{\"u}pft. Das Architekturmuster f{\"u}r MBS basiert auf dem Muster "Model View Controller (MVC)", welches um die Unterst{\"u}tzung mehrerer Varianten einer UI sowie die explizite Handhabung des Erbens von Verhalten erweitert wurde. Die im Rahmen der Arbeit ebenfalls entwickelte dom{\"a}nenspezifische Sprache (DSL) stellt M{\"o}glichkeiten zur Modellierung der MBS-Varianten und ihrer Verfeinerungsbeziehungen (Vererbung) untereinander bereit. Die verschiedenen Varianten einer MBS werden so in einer Baumstruktur (Verfeinerungsbaum) angeordnet, welche die Propagation einer Modifikation auf beliebig viele Varianten erm{\"o}glicht. Basierend auf dem Architekturmuster und der im Rahmen dieser Arbeit entwickelten Architektur wurden Unterst{\"u}tzungskonzepte entwickelt, welche auf einfache Nutzbarkeit durch den Entwickler ausgelegt sind. Explorative Unterst{\"u}tzungskonzepte machen den Entwicklungsstand der MBS transparent; sie visualisieren hierf{\"u}r den Verfeinerungsbaum sowie Schnittstellen zwischen Verhalten und Struktur. Interaktive Unterst{\"u}tzungskonzepte dagegen erm{\"o}glichen die gleichzeitige Modifikation einer oder mehrerer Varianten der MBS. Zentral dabei ist der Interpreter, welcher Benutzerschnittstellenmodelle direkt zur Interaktion bringt; dies Konzept sieht auch den Ausbau des Interpreters zu einem WYSIWYG-artigen Editor vor. Modulare Adaptionskonzepte schlie{\ss}lich kapseln spezifische Anpassungen (z.B. Skalierungen) in einer einfach durch den Entwickler nutzbaren Weise. Die Konzepte wurden im Rahmen eines Forschungsprojekt mit Industriepartnern konkret eingesetzt, mit Hilfe einer prototypischen Realisierung, genannt Mapache. Eine entwickelte Infrastruktur unterst{\"u}tzt hierf{\"u}r die Lauf- und Entwicklungszeit. Die in Eclipse realisierte Entwicklungsumgebung baut auf ihr auf und erm{\"o}glicht eine hoch integrierte Entwicklung Java basierter Multi-Benutzerschnittstellen. Abschlie{\ss}end wurden die entwickelten und realisierten Konzepte in einer Fallstudie des Projektes sowie einer Nutzerstudie evaluiert. Die Fallstudie zeigte, dass die erhobenen Anforderungen vom entwickelten Ansatz erf{\"u}llt werden. Die Nutzerstudie, durchgef{\"u}hrt in Form der sogenannten "Kooperativen Evaluation", ergab eine positive Bewertung des Ansatzes und zeigte Themen auf, welche bei der Anwendung des Ansatzes in der Praxis beachtet werden m{\"u}ssen.

        abstract = {Mobile live video broadcasting has become increasingly popular as means for novel social media interactions. Recent research mainly focused on bridging larger physical distances in large-scale events such as car racing, where participants are unable to spectate from a certain location in the event. In this paper, we advocate using live video streams not only over larger distances, but also in-situ in closed events such as soccer matches or concerts. We present CoStream, a mobile live video sharing system and present its iterative design process. We used CoStream as an instrument in a field study to investigate the in-situ co-construction of shared experiences during live events. We contribute our findings and outline future work.}

        abstract = {User input on television typically requires a mediator device such as a handheld remote control. While being a well-established interaction paradigm, a handheld device has serious drawbacks: it can be easily misplaced due to its mobility and in case of a touch screen interface, it also requires additional visual attention. Emerging interaction paradigms like 3D mid-air gestures using novel depth sensors such as Microsoft's Kinect aim at overcoming these limitations, but are known for instance to be tiring. In this paper, we propose to leverage the palm as an interactive surface for TV remote control. Our contribution is two-fold: (1) we have explored the conceptual design space in an exploratory study. (2) Based upon these results, we investigated the accuracy and effectiveness of such an interface in a controlled experiment. Our results show that the palm has the potential to be leveraged for device-less and eyes-free TV interactions without any third-party mediator device.}

As such, they face a cold start problem when attempting to assess an unknown service partner. State-of-the-art models address this by incorporating dispositional knowledge, the derivation of which is not described regularly. We propose three mechanisms for integrating knowledge readily available in cyber-physical services (e.g., online ordering) to determine the trust disposition of consumers towards unknown services (and their providers). These reputation-building indicators of trustworthiness can serve as cues for trust-based decision making in eCommerce scenarios and drive the evolution of reputation-based trust models towards trust management systems.}

While this has been explored for large projectors, the affordances of pico projectors are fundamentally different: they have a very small and strictly limited projection ray and can be carried around in a nomadic way during the day. Thus it is unclear how this could be actually leveraged for tangible interaction with physical, real world objects. We have investigated this in an exploratory field study and contribute the results. Based upon these, we present exemplary interaction techniques and early user feedback.}

Our proposal, in addition to considering the trustworthiness of nodes, ensures that the traffic load is equally shared amongst the population of nodes, thus further conserving mobile node resources. We analyse the proposed mechanisms and evaluate it against selected previously proposed trust schemes which, in the majority, favour the selection of the most trustworthy node. We demonstrate the benefits of our proposal which provides load balancing and prevents overuse of a single node?s resources, while still providing a good performance in regards to accurately choosing trustworthy nodes to provide the required content.},

Unfortunately the communication technology used by first responders today does not scale well. Also most of the given infrastructure, such as cell towers, might be destroyed. In recent research ad-hoc and peer-to-peer based communication has been proposed to solve the problem of resilient communication. Most mobile devices are equipped with wireless transceivers that make them suitable to participate in ad-hoc networks. But node density might be too small for a connected topology. In this paper we, therefore, discuss the implications of an emergency switch for private wireless routers allowing them to transition to an emergency mode to create a supportive wireless mesh network. To analyze if such a network would result in a resilient topology real data from wireless routers in a city is gathered. We calculate the locations of private and public routers from GPS traces and compare the resulting networks with each other.},

This work proposes new parallel algorithms to perform this arithmetical operation and determines the optimal number of processors that yields the greatest speedup. The optimal number is obtained by balancing the processing load evenly among the processors. Practical implementations are also performed to evaluate the theoretical proposals.},

We contribute two novel web page partitioning algorithms. They differ from existing approaches by allowing for both, automatic and semi-automatic partitioning. On the one hand, this provides good automatic, web page independent results by utilizing sophisticated structural pre- and postprocessing of the web page. On the other hand, these results can be improved by considering additional semantic information provided through user-generated web page annotations. We further present a performance evaluation of our algorithms. Moreover, we contribute the results of a user study. These clearly show that (1) our algorithms provide good automatic results and (2) the application of user-centric, annotation-based semantic information leads to a significantly higher user satisfaction.},

        abstract = {Durch die st{\"a}ndig fortschreitende Diversifizierung der Ger{\"a}te in der Computertechnik ergeben sich f{\"u}r Softwarehersteller neue Herausforderungen im Bereich Benutzerschnittstellen. Benutzerschnittstellen sollten an die neuen Ger{\"a}te angepasst werden, um gr{\"o}{\ss}tm{\"o}gliche Benutzbarkeit zu erzielen. Aus diesem Grund wird schon seit l{\"a}ngerem modell-getriebene Softwareentwicklung von Benutzerschnittstellen mit Modell-zu-Modell-Transformationen als m{\"o}glichem L{\"o}sungsansatz untersucht. Hierbei werden Modelle, die von den spezifischen Eigenschaften der Ger{\"a}te abstrahieren, in konkrete Modelle transformiert, die an deren Eigenschaften angepasst sind. Diese Modelle k{\"o}nnen dann direkt durch einen Interpreter dargestellt oder durch eine weitere Transformation in Quelltext {\"u}berf{\"u}hrt werden. Dadurch, dass f?ur viele Ger{\"a}te auch viele konkrete Modelle erzeugt werden m{\"u}ssen, werden auch entsprechend viele Modell-zu-Modell-Transformationen ben{\"o}tigt. {\"U}blicherweise werden diese Modell-zu-Modell-Transformationen von Entwicklern per Hand entwickelt. Der Entwicklungsaufwand ist entsprechend hoch. Um diesen zu reduzieren, k{\"o}nnen deklarative Modell-zu-Modell-Transformationssprachen eingesetzt werden, die die Programmierung erleichtern. Diese Arbeit besch{\"a}ftigt sich mit der Frage, welche Konzepte solche Sprachen unterst{\"u}tzen m{\"u}ssen, damit sie sich ?gut? zur Programmierung von Transformationen eignen. Ein Schwerpunkt dieser Arbeit liegt dabei auf der Generierung von Modellen grafischer Benutzerschnittstellen, da diese den Markt dominieren. Um dieses Problem anzugehen, werden Constraint Solving, Optimierung und verschiedene weitere Erweiterungen in Transformationssprachen integriert. Diese Integration erm{\"o}glicht die Deklaration von Constraints auf Komponenten von Benutzerschnittstellen, wie sie h{\"a}ufig in Ans{\"a}tzen zur Generierung von Benutzerschnittstellen ohne Transformationen schon verwendet wurden. Die neuen Konzepte werden Bestandteil der neuen Transformationssprache namens ?Solverational?. Im Rahmen der Implementierung wird eine Architektur und ein Interpreter vorgestellt. Um Transformationen mit bew{\"a}hrten Vorgehensmodellen entwickeln zu k{\"o}nnen, werden mehrere Schritte vorgestellt, um die diese erweitert werden k{\"o}nnen. Zur m{\"o}glichst anschaulichen Demonstration der Flexibilit{\"a}t der Transformationssprache wird eine Menge von Transformationen deklariert, die beispielhaft verschiedene sog. ?Strategien? zur Erzeugung von Modellen von Benutzerschnittstellen implementieren. Diese beschr{\"a}nken sich nicht auf grafische Benutzerschnittstellen, sondern zeigen die breite Anwendbarkeit der Konzepte. Zur Evaluation der Transformationssprache werden verschiedene Untersuchungen durchgef{\"u}hrt, die die Qualit{\"a}t von ?Solverational? messen. Die Ergebnisse der Untersuchungen zeigen, dass die neuen Sprachkonstrukte Transformationssprachen zur Transformation von Modellen von Benutzerschnittstellen verbessern k{\"o}nnen.},

        abstract = {User input on television (TV) typically requires a mediator device, such as a handheld remote control. While being a well-established interaction paradigm, a handheld device has serious drawbacks: it can be easily misplaced due to its mobility and in case of a touch screen interface, it also requires additional visual attention. Emerging interaction paradigms like 3D mid-air gestures using novel depth sensors, such as Microsoft's Kinect, aim at overcoming these limitations, but are known to be e.g. tiring. In this paper, we propose to leverage the palm as an interactive surface for TV remote control. Our contribution is three-fold: (1) we explore the conceptual design space in an exploratory study. (2) Based upon these results, we investigate the effectiveness and accuracy of such an interface in a controlled experiment. And (3), we contribute PalmRC: an eyes-free, palm-surface-based TV remote control, which in turn is evaluated in an early user feedback session. Our results show that the palm has the potential to be leveraged for device-less and eyes-free TV remote interaction without any third-party mediator device.},

        abstract = {Activity theory has gained increasing popularity as a tool for the design of interactive systems. Its central idea is that user actions can only be fully understood when analyzed within the context of motive-driven activities. However, this context is currently only partially explicit in existing models; e.g. the well-known model by Engestrom promotes social aspects of context, but does not make the physical and technical environment --- relevant aspects for interactive systems design --- explicit. We present a model that incorporates the social, physical and technical context of activities. This model supports designers and developers in understanding users, their activities and the respective contexts, and allows deriving requirements for the design process directly from the model. We believe this will prove especially helpful when designing for novel devices and multi-user scenarios. We illustrate the practical use of our model with examples from two domains: composition of IT services and co-located collaborative modeling.},

        abstract = {Current online Social Network Services (SNS) are organized around a single provider and while storage and functionality can be distributed, the control over the service belongs to one central entity. This structure raises privacy concerns over the handling of large-scale and at least logically centralized collections of user data. In an e?ort to protect user privacy and decrease provider dependence, decentralization has been proposed for SNS. This decentralization has e?ects on availability, opportunities for tra?c analysis, resource requirements, cooperation and incenctives, trust and accountability for di?erent entities, and performance. In this paper, we explore the spectrum of SNS implementations from centralized to fully decentralized and several hybrid constellations in between. Taking a systematic approach of SNS layers, decentralization classes, and replication strategies, we investigate the design space and focus on two issues as concrete examples where the contrast of extreme ends of the decentralization spectrum is illustrative, namely potential adversaries and churn-related pro?le availability. In general, our research indicates that hybrid approaches deserve more attention as both centralized as well as entirely decentralized systems su?er from severe drawbacks.},

        abstract = {Even at the beginning of the 21st century, we are far from becoming paperless. Pen and paper is still the only truly ubiquitous information processing technology. Pen-and-paper user interfaces bridge the gap between paper and the digital world. Rather than replacing paper with electronic media, they seamlessly integrate both worlds in a hybrid user interface. Classical paper documents become interactive. This opens up a huge field of novel computer applications at our workplaces and in our homes.  This book provides readers with a broad and extensive overview of the field, so as to provide a full and up-to-date picture of pen-and-paper computing. It covers the underlying technologies, reviews the variety of modern interface concepts and discusses future directions of pen-and-paper computing. Based on the author?s award-winning dissertation, the book also provides the first theoretical interaction model of pen-and-paper user interfaces and an integrated set of interaction techniques for knowledge workers. The model proposes a ?construction set? of core interactions that are helpful in designing solutions that address the diversity of pen-and-paper environments. The interaction techniques, concrete instantiations of the model, provide innovative support for working with printed and digital documents. They integrate well-established paper-based practices with concepts derived from hypertext and social media.  Researchers, practitioners who are considering deploying pen-and-paper user interfaces in real-world projects, and interested readers from other research disciplines will find the book an invaluable reference source. Also, it provides an introduction to pen-and-paper computing for the academic curriculum.  The present book was overdue: a thorough, concise, and well-organized compendium of marriages between paper-based and electronic documents.},

        abstract = {Energy is the most limiting factor in wireless sensor networks. Harvesting solar energy is a feasible solution to overcome the energy-constraint in some applications. It enables a theoretically infinite network lifetime, sustaining a mode of operation termed energy neutral consumption rate The challenge arises, how can the harvested energy be utilized to maximize the performance of the sensor network. Considering a field monitoring application the performance is measured as the sustained sampling rate of the sensors. Maximizing the sampling rate needs to take the spatio-temporal distribution of load and energy into account, to prevent the overloading of nodes. In [1] they introduced a optimal, theoretical solution based on perfect global knowledge. In this paper we propose the solar-aware distributed flow (SDF) approach. SDF enables each node to predict the harvested energy, calculate a sustainable flow and control its local neighborhood. To the best of our knowledge it is the first practical solution. Extensive simulations confirmed that SDF achieves over 80\% of the theoretical optimum, while introducing negligible overhead.},

        abstract = {People tend to interact and communicate with others throughout their life. In the age of pervasive computing, information and communication technology (ICT) that is no longer bound to desktop computers enables digital cooperations in everyday life and work in an unprecedented manner. However, the privacy and IT security issues inherent in pervasive computing are often associated with negative consequences for the users and the (information) society as a whole. Addressing this challenge, this thesis demonstrates that carefully devised protection mechanisms can become enablers for multilaterally acceptable and trustworthy digital interactions and cooperations. It contributes to the design of multilaterally secure cooperative pervasive systems by taking a scenario-oriented approach. Within our reference scenario of ICT-supported emergency response, we derive the following scientific research questions. Firstly, we investigate how to enable real-world auditing in pervasive location tracking systems, while striking a balance between privacy protection and accountability. Secondly, we aim to support communication between a sender and mobile receivers that are unknown by identity, while end-to-end security is enforced. The required concepts and mechanisms define the scope of what we denote as multilaterally secure pervasive cooperation. We take a novel integrated approach and provide the supporting security techniques and mechanisms. The main contributions of this thesis are (i) pseudonyms with implicit attributes, which is an approach to multilevel linkable transaction pseudonyms that is based on a combination of threshold encryption techniques, secure multiparty computation and cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generators, (ii) multilaterally secure location-based auditing, a novel consideration of auditing mechanisms in the context of real-world actions that reconciles privacy protection and accountability while proposing location traces as evidence, (iii) a hybrid encryption technique for expressive policies, which allows encrypting under policies that include a continuous dynamic attribute, leveraging an efficient combination of ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption, location-based encryption and symmetric encryption concepts, and (iv) end-to-end secure attribute-based messaging, a communication mechanism for end-to-end confidential messaging with receivers unknown by identity that is suitable also for resource constrained mobile devices. Harnessing these buildings blocks, we present an integrated architecture that supports location-aware first response. We therein consider location as the central integrating concept for pervasive cooperations. Both communication during incident handling as well as ex-post auditing are conceived as being location-based. Our research draws from experiences with potential real users (first responders and emergency decision makers) and from an interdisciplinary study. We contribute results derived from simulated court cases, indicating the trustworthiness and practicality of our proposal. Experiments conducted with prototype systems support the claim that our concepts are suitable for resource-constrained devices. In a theoretical analysis, we show that our security requirements are fulfilled. Our proposals have multiple further applications, e.g. to pseudonym-based access control.}

        abstract = {Recent advances in sensor technology provide new opportunities for applications that utilize the user's movement as an input source. This thesis focuses on movement analysis, which is a sub-area of a larger field concerned with the interpretation of sensor signals of human movement. Movement analysis can be used to provide feedback for training motor tasks, which is of interest for application areas such as rehabilitation, sports, and ergonomics. Consciously controllable, goal-directed movements, which we call primary movements, lead to slight movements in other parts of the body that are beyond conscious control (secondary movements). Secondary movements are generated due to the mechanical interaction with the environment and physiological dependencies of the body. This thesis contributes methods to distinguish between primary and secondary movements. This is necessary in order to provide high-quality feedback for motor tasks that show a significant amount of secondary movement. This can be the case when the secondary movements are large because of large reaction forces (e.g., when shooting a ball) or when the primary movements to execute the task are small (e.g., in various forms of handcraft or musical instrument performance). Furthermore, a precise distinction between primary and secondary movement can be necessary to check whether the user keeps a part of the body still (e.g., as required by a gymnastic exercise). Apart from sensor-based feedback, our results can also be used to improve current gesture recognition methods by ignoring secondary movement in the sensor signal to avoid that a secondary movement is misinterpreted as an execution of a gesture. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is shown in the context of pianist arm movements, which are particularly challenging to analyze. The distinction between primary and secondary movement in one joint of the arm is based on the measured movement in that particular joint, an estimation of key reaction force from MIDI data, and the movement in the other joints of the arm. In order to know on which arm the estimated key reaction force acts, it is necessary to determine which hand has played a note. For that purpose two methods are introduced: One method is based on MIDI; the other one uses data from inertial sensors in combination to MIDI. A third method based on Computer Vision, which was originally developed for sign language recognition, is evaluated here for tracking pianist hands. Based on the analysis methods, two pedagogical applications were developed: One application supports an existing piano pedagogical movement notation and checks whether the player's movement conforms to the indicated movement. A user study with piano students of a music university shows that potential users judge that the system is useful for the training of technique. The second application visualizes the sensor data and allows synchronizing different performances of the same piece, making it easy to spot differences where a closer examination may be beneficial.}

Usually, cloud providers provide assurances by specifying technical and functional descriptions in Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for the services they offer. The descriptions in SLAs are not consistent among the cloud providers even though they offer services with similar functionality. Therefore, customers are not sure whether they can identify a trustworthy cloud provider only based on its SLA. To support the customers in reliably identifying trustworthy cloud providers, we propose a multi-faceted Trust Management (TM) system architecture for a cloud computing marketplace.

        abstract = {Software applications are about to `leave' the desktop and to be used in a variety of different settings instead. When an application is developed, it cannot foreseen from which environments it will eventually be accessed. A good example for this are Web applications. They are accessed and used with many different Web browsers, depending on the user's choice. Many of the environments in which applications are accessed are becoming so-called post-desktop environments, i.e., environments that contain a variety of different interaction devices, beyond mouse, keyboard and screen, or even combinations of multiple interaction devices federated into a single UI. These environments are not necessarily equipped with a good network connection, so that the user may perceive disrupting latency due to the slow network connection, while interacting with applications The object of research of this thesis is the system infrastructure necessary to ensure that applications can be accessed in arbitrary post-desktop environments. We seek to augment and extend the Web system infrastructure to achieve this goal. This requires i) means to utilize novel interaction resources found in post-desktop environments, ii) coping with the dynamics of those environments, where resources are loosely coupled and iii) mitigating latency perceived by the user while interacting with Web applications in post-desktop environments. In pursuing this goal, the thesis makes the following contributions. In order to better understand the problem space, we developed a novel theoretical framework for describing the problem space of post-desktop access and use of applications. In order to handle the wealth and diversity of resources found in post-desktop environments one needs to be able to process input from arbitrary resources and to modify the output presented to the user at the same time. Existing approaches only support one of these two features at the same time. They are either optimized towards processing of input, in which case they rely on a pipeline architecture but then do not provide means for structured output modification. Or, they are optimized for modifying output, in which case their input-handling capabilities are limited to mouse and keyboard. The approach proposed in this thesis overcomes these limitations. Our concept of interaction strategies as realized in the MundoMonkey system can flexibly handle input from arbitrary sources, thanks to the connection to the MundoCore middleware, and at the same time can perform modifications of the UI using the rich DOM of Web applications. The approach has been evaluated by implementing several interaction strategies for interesting post-desktop environments, e.g., a strategy for voice-based interaction with Web applications proved superior to state-of-the-art solutions in a user study. In federated post-desktop environments the user has to deal not only with the diversity of resources, but also with the dynamics of the environment. Resources appear and disappear; the accessed applications must be easy to control for the user. We provides a single functionally complete meta UI to the user, allowing her to manage and control the post-desktop environment, which is not possible with existing approaches. The MineManager framework developed in this thesis is the first to enable the use of a digital meta UI in synchronization with physical changes to the access environment. An instance of this framework, called MineExplorer, has been implemented for the iPhone and the MundoCore middleware. It has been evaluated with user tests that showed the validity of the underlying concepts. The problem of user-perceived latency has been addressed for Web applications before. However, MundoProxy which is based on the concepts developed in this thesis is the only solution that can be used in mobile access environments, and which additionally does not require any changes to the implementation of the back-end services or the Web application. Application independence is achieved by using intelligent prefetching algorithms that predict future user requests based on observed previous requests. The peculiarities of mobile access environments are addressed by the piggybacking mechanisms that enable efficient use of the network bandwidth as well as of the energy of the mobile device battery. The evaluation shows that the user-perceived latency can be reduced up to \$25{$\backslash$}\%\$ with our approach. Finally, we propose MundoWeb, which integrates the three components explained above into a conservative extension to the Web access system addressing the requirements of post-desktop environments.},

Empirische Untersuchungen belegen die negativen Auswirkungen auf kognitive Leistung, Bearbeitungsdauer, Stressempfinden und physiologischen Zustand, die aufgrund spontaner Arbeitsunterbrechungen durch Kollegen und Kommunikationstechnologien verursacht werden. Diese Arbeit verfolgt das Ziel, ein Unterbrechungsmanagement-System in Form eines Virtuellen Assistenten zu konzipieren, mit welchem dem Wissensarbeiter Unterst{\"u}tzung angeboten werden soll. Der Virtuelle Assistent sch{\"a}tzt hierzu auf Basis multimodaler Sensorinformationen unter Zuhilfenahme statistischer Modelle den Kontext des Wissensarbeiters und ergreift Ma{\ss}nahmen zur Reduzierung der Unterbrechungskosten. Zur Analyse der Unterbrechungskosten wurde anhand verwandter Arbeiten ein umfassendes Faktorenmodell entwickelt, welches die Beziehung zwischen den Kontext beschreibenden Faktoren und den Auswirkungen von Unterbrechungen systematisch darstellt. Mit Blick auf das zu entwickelnde Unterbrechungsmanagement-System wurden anhand des Modells offene Faktoren identifiziert und daraus folgend in einem Laborexperiment die Auswirkungen von Unterbrechungen in Abh{\"a}ngigkeit der durchgef{\"u}hrten Aufgabenart, St{\"o}rungsmodalit{\"a}t und der Antizipation von Kontrolle untersucht. Es zeigt sich, dass sich der Aufwand zur expliziten Steuerung eines solchen Systems negativ auf das Stressniveau auswirken kann. Gest{\"u}tzt durch diese Erkenntnisse wurde entsprechend der autonom entscheidende Virtuelle Assistent umgesetzt. Im Rahmen der Entwicklung wurden umfangreiche Sensorkomponenten und Nutzerschnittstellen implementiert sowie ein adaptiver Lernkreislauf entwickelt, um eine nutzerspezifische Anpassung des statistischen Modells zu erm{\"o}glichen. Der Prototyp des Virtuellen Assistenten wurde abschlie{\ss}end in einem Feldtest dazu eingesetzt, verschiedene Algorithmen aus dem Bereich des Maschinellen Lernens hinsichtlich ihrer Klassifikationsg{\"u}te zur Kontextbestimmung zu untersuchen.},

        abstract = {Peer-to-Peer networks are divided into two main classes: unstructured and structured. Overlays from the first class are better suited for exhaustive search, whereas those from the second class offer very efficient key-value lookups. In this paper we present a novel overlay, PathFinder , which combines the advantages of both classes within one single overlay for the first time. Our evaluation shows that PathFinder is comparable or even better in terms of lookup and complex query performance than existing peer-to-peer overlays and scales to hundreds of millions of nodes. Peers in PathFinder are arranged as Erdo ?s Renyi random graph. Consequently, all overlay operations such as key-value lookup, complex queries and main- tenance messages greatly benefit from the short average path length, the high number of alternative paths and the robustness of the underlying random graph topology.}

Over the past years, proposals have been made to model trust relations computationally, either to assist users or for modeling purposes in multi-agent systems. These models rely implicitly on the social networks established by participating entities (be they autonomous agents or internet users). However, state-of-the-art trust frameworks often neglect the structure of those complex networks. In this paper, we present a new approach allowing agent-based trust frameworks to leverage information from both trusted and untrusted witnesses that would otherwise be neglected. An effective and robust voting scheme based on an agreement metric is presented and its benefit is shown through simulations.},

However, a context only considers the present and neglects the high dynamics of the situation, including the past and the future, it is embedded in. We argue that this leads to a fundamental context-modeling problem. Moreover, we propose a new model for describing highly dynamic environments with situations, contexts and circumstances.

        abstract = {Communication between first responders is vital to the success of large scale disaster management. But communication technologies used by first responders today do not scale well due to heterogeneity, point-to-point connections, and centralized communication structures. As the popularity of devices equipped with Wi-Fi grows, the number of access points (APs) in city centers increases as well. This communication infrastructure exists and should be used in city wide disasters as it is readily available in areas with high population density. In this paper, we investigate Wi-Fi access points in 5 major cities deployed in stores, bars, and restaurants. We want to answer the question if these APs can be used as a mesh networking backbone in disaster response. The main contributions of this paper are (i) the surveyed and analyzed public Wi-Fi layout of five major cities and (ii) the connectivity analysis of the city wide network topology.},

        abstract = {Nowadays the majority of users are unable to properly configure security mechanisms mostly because they are not usable for them. To reach the goal of having usable security mechanisms, the best solution is to minimize the amount of user interactions and simplify configuration tasks. Automation is a proper solution for minimizing the amount of user interaction. Fully automated security systems are possible for most security objectives, with the exception of the access control policy generation. Fully automated access control policy generation is currently not possible because individual preferences must be taken into account and, thus, requires user interaction. To address this problem we propose a mechanism that assists users to generate proper access control rule sets that reflect their individual preferences. We name this mechanism Interactive Rule Learning for Access Control (IRL). IRL is designed to generate concise rule sets for Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC). The resulting approach leads to adaptive access control rule sets that can be used for so called smart products. Therefore, we first describe the requirements and metrics for usable access control rule sets for smart products. Moreover, we present the design of a security component which implements, among other security functionalities, our proposed IRL on ABAC. This design is currently being implemented as part of the ICT 7th Framework Programme SmartProducts of the European Commission.}

        abstract = {Nodes in mobile networks are usually unevenly distributed over space. Several dense clusters of nodes are interconnected by a few nodes in sparsely occupied areas. Removing vital nodes along such bridges would partition the network and severely reduce the overall connectivity. Consequently, detecting and protecting those few vital nodes is crucial for keeping the network operational. In order to achieve this task, we present our novel approach: BridgeFinder. Most importantly, BridgeFinder allows us to calculate good estimates for global graph measures, while operating as a fully distributed algorithm and causing only very little messaging overhead. It is based on an extension of the Push-Sum gossiping protocol and is significantly faster and more precise than existing mechanisms. We also show how BridgeFinder can be implemented in practice and show that it is very robust against malicious nodes attempting to skew the gossiping protocol.},

Our everyday environments are just too chaotic to allow top-down design of ubiquitous computing systems. Creating ubiquitous computing systems in a bottom-up manner has some inherent problems, which have not been successfully addressed in any existing approach, hence the scarcity of real-world ubiquitous computing systems. This article describes the Mundo Method for designing and implementing ubiquitous computing systems, which addresses two of these problems: structuring, i.e., separating the spontaneously emerging system into meaningful ensem- bles and orchestration, i.e., providing meaningful behaviour for an ensemble. The Mundo Method heavily relies on the MundoCore communication middleware, which is especially suited for ubiquitous computing applications.}

Dealing with these challenges, the contribution of this paper is four-fold: first, together with emergency practioners we define realistic security requirements and patterns for ubiquitous emergency communication. Second, we devise techniques for privacy-respecting re-identificaton of pseudonymous receivers. Third, we propose a new hybrid encryption technique for expressive policies, which combines ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption with location-based encryption. Fourth, building on the new techniques, we introduce MundoMessage, our approach to multilaterally end-to-end secure, user-friendly attribute-based messaging for emergency communication. Finally, we analyze our approach.},

Because of the formal foundation and the clear declaration of subjects, S-BPM allows the distributed modeling and execution of processes, without losing the capability to verify the compatibility of processes. Executing cooperating processes in a distributed system also poses new requirements to the communication middleware, which is responsible for routing messages from one process instance to a remote peer process instance. In this paper, we describe an engine to execute S-BPM process choreographies. It is based on subject-oriented process modeling and a publish/subscribe middleware as communication basis.

        abstract = {Intelligent environments aim at supporting the user in executing her everyday tasks, e.g. by guiding her through a maintenance or cooking procedure. This requires a machine processable representation of the tasks for which workflows have proven an efficient means. The increasing number of available sensors in intelligent environments can facilitate the execution of workflows. The sensors can help to recognize when a user has finished a step in the workflow and thus to automatically proceed to the next step. This can heavily reduce the amount of required user interaction. However, manually specifying the conditions for triggering the next step in a workflow is very cumbersome and almost impossible for environments which are not known at design time. In this paper, we present a novel approach for learning and adapting these conditions from observation. We show that the learned conditions can even outperform the quality as conditions manually specified by workflow experts. Thus, the presented approach is very well suited for automatically adapting workflows in intelligent environments and can in that way increase the efficiency of the workflow execution.}

Trust models provide excellent means for sup- porting users in their decision making process. How- ever, those models require an exchange of information between users, which can pose a threat to the users' privacy. In this paper, we present a novel approach for a privacy preserving computation of trust. Besides pre- serving the privacy of the recommenders by exchanging and aggregating recommendations under encryption, the proposed approach is the first that enables the trusting entities to learn about the trustworthiness of their recommenders at the same time. This is achieved by linking the minimum amount of information that is required for the learning process to the actual rec- ommendation and by using zero-knowledge proofs for assuring the correctness of this additional information.},

The complexity of the resulting work processes makes task externalization a desired goal towards facilitating analysis and support of knowledge work, e.g. by extracting and disseminating best practices.  In this paper, we present a task mining method that identifies tasks based on interaction histories. The method generates instances of a semantic hierarchical task model which captures an abstraction of the work processes. A specific characteristic of the method is that it mines tasks based on a combination of semantic and temporal features, extracted from enriched interaction histories. The use of semantic similarity results in a high robustness of the system with respect to task interruption and concurrent task execution. An evaluation of our task mining method based on a study with users executing frequently interrupted tasks is presented. One element of the evaluation is the assessment of different algorithms for semantic similarity computing, namely Term Matching (TM), Vector Space Model (VSM) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). For an approach using VSM a precision of 0.83, a recall of 0.76 and a F1-measure of 0.79 is reached.},

        abstract = {Tracking information of individuals is a useful input to many Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp) applications. Consider the example of a smart emergency management application: once mobile first responders are continuously tracked, a precise and safe coordination of rescue missions is possible, and also mission logs can be created for audit purposes. However, continuously tracking users and storing the data for later use is often in conflict with individual privacy preferences. This may ultimately lead to the non-acceptance and rejection of these new technologies by their users. In order to reconcile privacy and accountability requirements in location tracking systems, we introduce and evaluate the approach of using auditing mechanisms on two levels. We illustrate that, by employing carefully designed cryptographic mechanisms for selective pseudonym linkability based on efficient techniques of secure multiparty computation, it is possible to balance the conflicting interests to A certain extent. Our work, motivated by and applied to smart emergency management systems, is a step towards the realization of multilaterally secure and thus multilaterally acceptable UbiComp systems supporting collaborative work.},

Overlays from the first class are better suited for exhaustive search, whereas those from the second class offer very efficient key-value lookups. In this paper we present a novel overlay, PathFinder , which combines the advantages of both classes within one single overlay for the first time. Our evaluation shows that PathFinder is comparable or even better in terms of lookup and complex query performance than existing peer-to-peer overlays and scales to hundreds of millions of nodes. Peers in PathFinder are arranged as Erd?os Renyi random graph. Consequently, all overlay operations such as key-value lookup, complex queries and maintenance messages greatly benefit from the short average path length, the high number of alternative paths and the robustness of the underlying random graph topology.},

This fault-tolerant approach does neither require maintenance of any global network state nor knowledge of network structure. However, although gossip-based aggregation algorithms scale well for graphs with good expansion, their efficiency for sparse graphs is unexamined. In this paper we analyze the feasibility and efficiency of a gossip aggregation protocol in wireless networks with low expansion. We propose a modification of the existing aggregation algorithm for use in locality-aware, sparse, static wireless networks. Our protocol terminates autonomously, uses less bandwidth than the original version, and removes the need for the leader election process while counting network nodes. Aggregates are calculated only over nodes placed in the vicinity, and nodes communicate only with their immediate neighbors by using a wireless broadcast. We evaluate our approach by simulation on sparse, irregular graphs with low expansion for the simplified system model. Furthermore, we analytically assess the worst-case time and message complexity of this protocol for sparse wireless networks and also for the simplified system model.},

First, we setup a design space for and contribute seven novel interface concepts, which rely on GUI-based, on touch-based, and on tangible interaction. Second, we present the results of an in-depth evaluation and comparison of these concepts. They are based on an ascriptive analysis of over 18 hours of video observations from a controlled experiment with 44 participants. The results provide insights on common usability errors and misconceptions. Third, we derive implications for the design of mobile video browsers to minimize errors and to increase usability.},

The presented system called Q\&A 2.0 addresses two particular challenges that were insufficiently met so far. First, it supports users to ask and answer questions in the questions? contexts and to link them with the learning material. Secondly, it allows seamless transitions to asynchronous forms of learning, i.e. to the period after a lecture.}

        abstract = {The concept of data formats is central to information storage and exchange, as it coins the process of how information is written to and read back from format-compliant data by senders and receivers. In contrast to the widespread use of natural-language descriptions intended for human engineers, and of procedural definitions of format-compliant components, describing data format knowledge in a formal, declarative manner is necessary for making this knowledge machine-processible, enabling its flexible, automated application to format-compliant data. To that effect, data format knowledge is considered both on the level of format-compliant data as a data format instance and on the level of a data format consisting of such instances. In a survey of current State of the Art in Data Format Description, examined related work from the data-centric research domains of Digital Preservation, Multimedia and Telecommunication show a lack suitable formalised models for universal applicability. As well, examined related work provides only a subset of the four necessary descriptive capabilities to describe data which may be primitive, structured, transcoded or fragmented. In the analysis, a formalisation is presented which is based on the research hypothesis that a data format defines a normative set of lossless information representations, where there exists a bijective mapping between interal representations of senders / receivers, and external representations that are exchanged as format-compliant data. The formalisation is universally applicable for arbitrary data formats, is suitable for both so-called lossless and lossy data formats, and leads to the notion of four elementary descriptive capabilities, which exactly match those used in the State of the Art survey. A valid Portable Network Graphics (PNG) raster image is given as ``litmus test'' for data format description, as its description exercises all four elementary descriptive capabilities. Based on the formalisation, it is shown that a universal approach to data format description is too powerful in computational terms as to be able to guarantee termination, that the tractability of bijective mapping functions and their inverses is neither given nor necessarily related, and that one-to-one correspondence of a bijective mapping function can be guaranteed using information-preserving, Turing-complete Reversible Turing Machines. Building on the formalisation given in the analysis, the thesis defines the Bitstream Segment Graph (BSG) model for describing arbitrary data format instances. For BSG instances, representations are defined both for visualisation as well as for storage and exchange through machine-processible, RDF-based representations. Incremental construction and modification of BSG instances is enabled through a closed set of operations, and the ``coverage'' of a BSG instance is defined as a measure of its completeness. Actual tool support for the construction, modification and exploration of BSG instances on arbitrary data is provided through the Apeiron BSG Editor. Applications of the BSG model are demonstrated through the description of the PNG image ``litmus test'' from the previous analysis, and for the description of an exploit in the context of IT Security. Building on the BSG model, the thesis defines the BSG Reasoning approach for describing arbitrary data formats as potentially infinite sets of data format instances. Using logic rules, a BSG instance can be inferred for a given bit sequence which is considered to be format-compliant data. The BSG Reasoning approach defines the representation of rulesets for storage and exchange. Applications of BSG Reasoning are demonstrated through the description of a PNG image file format subset and through an outlined approach for format-aware fuzzing of bitstreams in IT Security. The PNG image file format subset described through BSG Reasoning exercises all elementary descriptive capabilities previously identified in the analysis, and it is shown that the resulting set of logic rules, despite a low number of format-specific rules, already yields a high coverage of inferred BSG instances on a number of valid PNG images. The thesis closes with a retrospection, conclusions and an outlook on potential future research on the BSG model and the BSG Reasoning approach, focusing on aspects such as the computer-aided reverse-engineering of data format rules, or the use of reversible programming languages for the definition of lossless coding and transformation functions.},

        abstract = {Two trends can be observed in current applications: the amount of functionality offered is constantly increasing and applications are more often used in mobile settings. Both trends often lead to a decrease in the usability of applications. This effect can be countered by Intelligent User Interfaces that facilitate the interaction between user and application. In order to support the user in an optimal way, the Intelligent User Interface has to be aware of the user?s needs and adapt the provided support to her current situation, i.e. her current context. The relevant context information can thereby be gathered from the environment (e.g. her current location) or from sophisticated user models that reflect the user?s behavior. In this thesis, we present a novel approach of combining user and environmental context information for supporting the system use. As context information is often very error-prone and the user?s workflow should not be disrupted by erroneous interaction support, we adapt the presentation of the support to the reliability of the context information. Therefore, we use different levels of proactivity from unobtrusive highlighting to automatically performing tasks. The presented approach -called AUGUR- is application independent and is able to support the interaction for arbitrary existing applications, even across application boundaries. For that purpose, we developed a novel application modeling language that is able to model applications and their relationships to context. The application models can thereby be defined by the application developer, learned by AUGUR, and augmented by the end-user. The interaction can be facilitated by an Intelligent User Interface in two different ways: on the one hand by supporting the entering of data and on the other hand by simplifying the navigation within and between applications. For supporting the user in entering data, we contribute three approaches based on (i) the user?s previous interactions, (ii) the information represented in the application models, and (iii) the semantics of the data required by the user interface and the context information currently relevant for the user. For the latter, we developed a novel algorithm that combines string-based and semantic similarity measures. AUGUR supports the user?s navigation in three different ways: It can (i) guide the user through an application, (ii) provide navigation shortcuts to other applications, and (iii) reduce the user interface to the most relevant functionality for mobile use. For guiding the user, we developed a novel algorithm called FxL that is able to predict the next relevant interaction element. For the interface adaptation, we introduce a novel approach based on FxL to determine the elements that should be presented to the user for mobile use according to her current situation. We realized the developed concepts of AUGUR in a working prototype. Further, we evaluated the usability of the context-aware support provided by AUGUR in a user study, and showed that it can significantly increase the usability of an application.},

        abstract = {Concise and reliable graph-theoretic analysis of complex net- works today is a cumbersome task, consisting essentially of the adaptation of intricate libraries for each specific prob- lem instance. The growing number of complex metrics that have been proposed in the last years, which mainly gain significance due to the increasing computational capabili- ties at hand, have led to important new insights in the field. However, they have solely been implemented as single algo- rithms, each specialized for the purpose of calculating exactly the targeted metric for a selected type of network graph. A comprehensive, extensible tool for the concise evaluation of graphs is currently not available. For this purpose we intro- duce the Graph-Theoretic Network Analyzer (GTNA), an ef- ficient, Java-based toolkit for the comprehensive analysis of complex network graphs. GTNA, while already including the main metrics that are used to analyze the complex networks in computer science today, is simple to extend through a well defined plugin interface for metrics, network descriptions and network generator models. Throughout the paper we present the design and simple extensibility of GTNA, as well as the network models and metrics that are already implemented and give examples of its scalability and performance.}

          author = {Markus Weimer},
          school = {Technische Universit{\"a}t Darmstadt},
        abstract = {Many applications of Technology Enhanced Learning are based on strong assumptions: Knowledge needs to be standardized, structured and most of all externalized into learning material that preferably is annotated with meta-data for efficient re-use. A vast body of valuable knowledge does not meet these assumptions, including informal knowledge such as experience and intuition that is key to many complex activities. We notice that knowledge, even if not standardized, structured and externalized, can still be observed through its application. We refer to this observable knowledge as Practiced Knowledge. We propose a novel approach to Technology Enhanced Learning named Machine Teaching to convey this knowledge: Machine Learning techniques are used to extract machine models of Practiced Knowledge from observational data. These models are then applied in the learner's context for his support. We identify two important subclasses of machine teaching, General and Detailed Feedback Machine Teaching. General Feedback Machine Teaching aims to provide the learner with a "grade-like" numerical rating of his work. This is a direct application of supervised machine learning approaches. Detailed Feedback Machine Teaching aims to provide the learner with in-depth support with respect to his activities. An analysis showed that a large subclass of Detailed Feedback Machine Teaching applications can be addressed through adapted recommender systems technology. The ability of the underlying machine learning techniques to capture structure and patterns in the observational data is crucial to the overall applicability of Machine Teaching. Therefore, we study the feasibility of Machine Teaching from a machine learning perspective. Following this goal, we evaluate the General Feedback Machine Teaching approach using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques: The exemplary Machine Teaching system is sought to provide the learner with quality estimations of his writing as judged by an online community. The results obtained in this evaluation are supportive of the applicability of Machine Teaching to this domain. To facilitate Detailed Feedback Machine Teaching, we present a novel matrix factorization model and algorithm. In addition to addressing the needs of Machine Teaching, it is also a contribution to the recommender systems field as it facilitates ranking estimation. An Evaluation in a Detailed Feedback Machine Teaching scenario for software engineers supports the feasibility of Machine Teaching in that domain. We therefore conclude that machine learning models capable of capturing important aspects of practiced knowledge can be found in both, General and Detailed Feedback Machine Teaching. Machine Teaching does not assume the knowledge to be externalized, but to be observable and therefore adds another body of knowledge to Technology Enhanced Learning not amenable to traditional Technology Enhanced Learning approaches.},

This leads to two key challenges: how to create these multiple UIs for one application (creation challenge), and how to consistently modify them (modification challenge). The creation challenge has been addressed in various works utilizing automatic UI generation. We present a domain specific lan- guage (DSL) suitable to address the modification challenge. The DSL makes use of explicit relations between different UI versions, along which modications of the UIs can be propagated. With the presented approach, modifications can be applied more easily, which is important for iterative (UI) design.},

Therefore, to lower the skill barrier for developers, it is im- portant to describe the problem at hand on an abstract level and not to focus on implementation details. This can be done using declarative programming which allows to describe only the result of the problem (which is what the developer wants) rather than the description of the implementation. We therefore use purely declarative model-to-model transformations written in a universal model transformation language which is capable of handling even non functional properties using optimization and mathematical programming. This makes it easier to understand and describe service composition and non- functional properties for the developer.}

However, businesses must ensure that external services are compatible with their processes and that they can quickly adapt if service offering changes on the market. This raises the need for a process definition language with a formal foundation and well-defined semantics. In this paper, we discuss the suitability of different process definition languages for automatic service composition, show that subject-oriented modeling with PASS is well-suited for this domain, and how automatic service composition is implemented in the Theseus/TEXO project.}

However, research regarding the application domains of PPI has yet been focussed on knowledge work, despite the highly mobile and casual nature of paper. We argue, that the overlooked domain of mundane or everyday tasks requires additional attention and adds special requirements to supporting technologies and infrastructures. This is grounded on a case study in the domain of shopping planning support.},

We contribute the results of a comprehensive field study which analyzes how the information flow is currently performed within different units and persons in the command and control center. These findings provide insights into key aspects of current workflows which should be preserved by novel technological solutions. As our second contribution, by using a participatory design approach and based on our findings, we present a novel approach for computer support in command and control centers. This relies on digital pens and paper and smoothly integrates traditional paper-based workflows with computing, thereby combining the advantages of paper and those of computers.},

Becoming more and more similar to PCs and laptops, they will also begin to face the same security problems especially in terms of network security. In a previous paper, we have provided a detailed analysis of security issues along with penetration test results for Windows Mobile 5.0 platform based smartphones. In this paper, we extend our vulnerability testing with two more smartphones, both based on the Symbian 9.1 OS. A number of attacks have been done to test the stability of the network stack of the Symbian OS. Detailed results are provided from the tests performed and several vulnerabilities that can render the devices unusable have been found. The results should be very useful for security professionals, researchers and OS vendors and will hopefully result in more attention to be paid to security issues in smartphones and trigger the development of more secure software for mobile operating systems. The findings could also be of interest for end-users who are searching for the most stable platform for mobile applications where security and reliability are key factors.{\ensuremath{<}}/div{\ensuremath{>}}},

        abstract = {In the vision of ubiquitous computing, the activities of daily life are supported by a multitude of heterogeneous, loosely coupled computing devices. The support of seamless collaboration between users, as well as between their devices, can be seen as one of the key challenges for this vision to come true. This thesis provides a trust based approach to supporting the selection of trustworthy interaction partners. The goal of this approach is to estimate an entity's trustworthiness as accurately as possible in order to improve the average quality of the entity's interactions. In this thesis, the trustworthiness of an entity is derived from evidence gained during past interactions. To this end, current Bayesian trust models are extended and improved regarding the following aspects: (i) better integration of the characteristics of the application context, (ii) more intuitive access to the trust model, and (iii) better integration of recommendations by third parties. The last aspect is important as there are numerous situations in which direct evidence between entities is rare. The proposed approach provides means for the robust integration of recommendations provided by third parties, especially considering attacks by entities intentionally providing misleading recommendations. Scientific Contribution: The scientific contribution of this thesis is summarized as follows: The trust model that is provided in this thesis extends Bayesian trust models in order to improve the integration of context-dependent parameters, such as dispositional trust and aging of evidence. Furthermore, a parameter called maximum number of evidence units allows the user to define the number of evidence that is expected to be sufficient for being representative for an entity's behavior within a certain application context. In the proposed model, the dispositional trust can be assessed according to the preference of the user; alternatively, a new approach for deriving the dispositional trust from the behavior of previously encountered entities is provided. The proposed interrelation between the aging and the maximum number of expected evidence units allows the limitations of current Bayesian trust models to be overcome. The thesis shows that in those models, aging either does not have an impact on the expectation value in the absence of evidence, or it narrows the range of the expectation value. A second representation of trust - called the Human Trust Interface (HTI) - is proposed providing for an easier access to the model by human users. This representation is based on a simple set of parameters. These parameters are also the basis for a graphical representation allowing users to interpret and adjust the trust values of other entities intuitively. As the model supports two different representations a mapping between both representations is required in order to switch between both representations. The provided mapping allows users and developers of trust models to benefit from the advantages of both representations. The distributed computational model that is proposed for the aggregation of direct evidence and recommendations has been designed to be especially robust to so-called Sybil attacks, which occur when a single party tries to multiply the influence of its recommendations by creating a high number of seemingly independent entities. This is achieved using the accuracy of a recommender's past recommendations as well as the rank of the recommender in order to limit a recommender's influence. Especially, considering the rank of a recommender, i.e., its position in the group of recommenders, provides a means for limiting the influence of a potentially infinite number of malicious recommenders under certain circumstances. Evaluation: The trust model has been evaluated in two user studies which support that users feel comfortable with the proposed graphical representation. Furthermore, in the simulation of collaboration in an opportunistic network, the model shows a good performance regarding the estimation of an entity's trustworthiness and regarding the average quality of interactions when using the trust model to find the best interaction partner. This results from the comparison to a state-of-the-art approach, as well as from a comparison to an artificial model that is initialized with the system variables of the simulation model, and therefore serves as perfect selection strategy. The simulation shows the results of the different approaches over a set of 15 populations, which have been canonically derived from the system model, modeling entities with different typical behaviors.},

        abstract = {Today's knowledge work is characterized by the simultaneous use of paper and digital documents. This implies disruptive transitions from paper to digital media and vice versa, particularly because interaction techniques differ in the two worlds. For instance, traditional references are created and followed differently than digital hyperlinks. This thesis advances the integration of paper and digital documents. It contributes empirically-grounded conceptual work in the fields of interaction theory, interaction techniques and interactive systems. Three initial field studies explore how paper and digital media are used in learning at universities. They provide evidence for the high importance of paper and show that, in many settings, the use of printed information exists in parallel with using digital documents. Based on these results, an ecological perspective of knowledge work is chosen as the approach for developing the theoretical basis of this thesis. This perspective advocates an integral view on the ensemble of collaborating users, of physical and digital artifacts, of work practices and of their interplay. By generalizing the findings of the empirical field studies and based on the ecological perspective, we develop a theoretical interaction model of Pen-and-Paper User Interfaces (PPUIs). This model is of analytical value and provides guidance on how to design PPUIs that are easy and intuitive to use. Its underlying principle is a systematic separation between a semantic and a syntactic level of interaction. Based on this separation, syntactic interaction primitives are identified, which act as building blocks for PPUIs that support semantic activities. Furthermore, we contribute novel interaction techniques and visualizations for cross-media knowledge work with documents. These are based on the interaction model and provide support for annotating, linking and tagging, all in a hybrid setting of printed and digital documents. First, in the field of paper-based annotation, we introduce the concept of user-adaptable printed interfaces. Moreover, we significantly advance asynchronous sharing by presenting a paper-based mechanism for sharing annotations and a visualization that integrates handwritten annotations of multiple users. Second, we contribute a pen-based interaction technique for creating and following cross-media hyperlinks between printed and digital documents. The same digital pen and the same interactions can be used both on printed documents and on digital documents on a tabletop screen. Third, we contribute four novel techniques for tagging documents and processes. These offer a rich user experience being inspired by the varied practices of using paper. They leverage tangible stickers, paper cards for defining and applying tags, printed buttons, and other tangible objects. Moreover, this thesis contributes CoScribe, a system framework for collaborative cross-media knowledge work. This integrates the interaction techniques and visualizations into a consistent and coherent concept. Following the ecological perspective, CoScribe covers entire workflows with a strong emphasis on collaboration. Finally, we present evaluation results. We implemented a working prototype of CoScribe, which was used in three evaluation studies. Their results provide evidence that CoScribe significantly enhances both work performance and user satisfaction.}

Service composition requires the knowledge of various process languages (e.g. WS-BPEL, XPDL, or WSFL) or the knowledge of languages like WS-CDL which focus more on messaging aspects. To choose the right language for the problem at hand requires a lot of research as different aspects of various languages need to be considered. Therefore, to lower the skill barrier for developers it is important to describe the problem on an abstract level and not to focus on implementation details. This can be done using declarative programming which fosters to describe only the result of the problem (which is what the developer wants) rather than the description of the implementation. We therefore use purely declarative model-to-model transformations written in a universal model transformation language which is capable of handling even non-function properties using optimization and mathematical programming. This makes it easier to understand and describe service composition and non-fuctional properties for the developer.},

An approach to solve this issue is to introduce a trust or reputation system, enabling market participants to identify trustworthy parties. An open market does not have access restrictions to the market, hence such systems are likely to be exposed to Sybil attacks. In this paper, we provide a novel approach for aggregating recommendations in the face of Sybil attacks, which allow a single party to try to multiply the influence of its recommendation(s) by creating a high number of seemingly independent entities.},

While many of these advances can be incorporated in the code recommendation setting this problem also brings considerable challenges of its own. In this paper, we extend state-of-the-art collaborative filtering technology, namely Maximum Margin Matrix Factorization (MMMF) to this interesting application domain and show how to deal with the challenges posed by this problem. To this end, we introduce two new loss functions to the MMMF model. While we focus on code recommendation in this paper, our contributions and the methodology we propose can be of use in almost any collaborative setting that can be represented as a binary interaction matrix. We evaluate the algorithm on real data drawn from the Eclipse Open Source Project. The results show a significant improvement over current rule-based approaches.}

The resulting interaction design comprising collaboration support and multiuser visualizations has been implemented and evaluated in user studies.

        abstract = {Business Process Management (BPM) solutions enable enterprises to consolidate and optimize their business operations and to gain competitive advantage in the fast evolving global market. Often, the only ones to understand the matter and complexity of business processes are the end users of enterprise software, who execute them on a daily basis. The need to involve end users in business process composition during the implementation of BPM solutions in enterprises is clearly perceived. However, end users have a detailed domain expertise but limited technical skills. Therefore upfront process modeling through conventional modeling notations remains inaccessible for them. The need for user-centric process composition approaches arises, which can enable end users to tailor business processes according to their actual expertise and problem solving strategies. Furthermore, these approaches need to bridge the process understanding of end users and technically skilled process designers and developers in the course of workflow projects in order to facilitate the development of real-life compliant and consistent process models and to streamline the uptake of BPM software in enterprises. This thesis addresses end-user driven composition of both: (i) weakly-structured process models for supporting underspecified, human-centric business processes and (ii) structured business process models for automation of rigidly recurring processes through workflow engines. Both process types are composed through programming by example in a collaborative task management system. Task management is chosen as a starting point for end-user driven process composition in order to reconcile the personal and the enterprise perspectives on business processes. Programming by example is an end-user development technique, which enables capturing and repeated execution of user activities in a software system. The application of this technique in an enterprise scope for the composition of business process models is novel and requires specific support from user?s perspective and from formal system?s perspective. The four major scientific contributions of the thesis can be captured as: (i) a task management model for human-centric business processes; (ii) a method for composition of weakly-structured process models through collaborative task management; (iii) a method for transformation of weakly-structured process models to structured workflows and their refinement based on deviations with ad-hoc tasks at runtime; (iv) the holistic concept for end-user driven business process composition through programming by example, composing contributions (i) through (iii) into a seamless overarching method and architecture for the composition of weakly-structured and structured process models. The elaborated concepts provide a significant contribution to known process modeling approaches in various research areas such as human-computer interaction, BPM, workflow management and computer supported cooperative work. The presented concepts found on preliminary empirical studies, comprising an online questionnaire distributed to a number of companies from various industries, and a series of field studies in three German small and medium enterprises. The preliminary studies deliver strong support for end-user development in the domain of task management and identify entry points for introducing process tailoring to end users. These studies provide input for the elaborated task management model and drive the design choices for the architecture, underling the presented holistic concept. The presented concepts take into consideration existing end user work practices and software applications for management of day-to-day activities, such as email and personal to-do list applications delivered with standard office environments. The task management model enables aggregation of data from these applications for the composition of weakly-structured business process models. These models can be repeatedly adapted and reused for the execution of ad-hoc, human-centric processes. The method for generation of structured workflows from weakly-structured process models enables automation of rigidly recurring processes through workflow engines. Generated workflows can be extended by process designers and developers, in a shared context between user-defined and formal process models. The mapping of weakly-structured process models to structured workflow models facilitates data reuse between ad-hoc and operational processes. Enhanced data sharing and interoperability between ad-hoc and structured processes is enabled through the introduced holistic concept and the underlying architecture. The presented concepts have been implemented and validated through a prototype called Collaborative Task Manager. The evaluation results confirm that the proposed end-user development approach and its enterprise-wide application through the presented concepts efficiently enable end-user driven business process composition. Thus the specified task management model, methods and holistic concept can be used for designing user-tailorable BPM systems that facilitate the adoption of BPM technology in enterprises.},

The creation challenge has been addressed in various works utilizing automatic UI generation.

        abstract = {In DHT overlay networks nodes tend to be imbalanced with respect to their lookup resolution and messaging load, as well as in their relevance to the function of the system. Analyzing DHTs in detail, it becomes apparent that the difference in load and relevance is sometimes even quite extreme. This can lead to a serious impact on the performance, as the load is not evenly balanced and single node failures result in disruptions of the service and potentially high additional repair costs. A balancing for load and relevance usually comes at a high overhead for global monitoring, messaging and rearranging the nodes and their connections. Motifs have recently be proposed as a new metric for the analyzis of networks.  In difference to most other metrics, they can be calculated locally with scopes of an arbitrarily selected horizon and still give a good indication about the different qualities of global topologies. We propose to locally observe the topological motifs and to rearrange local links in order to achieve a better load balance without the additional messaging costs. For this purpose we identify characteristic motif signatures of exemplary perfect topologies of the different DHTs, and define rules for nodes to locally adapt their neighborhood to these optimal signatures. This text represents a work in progress report, a more detailed analysis will be presented to the research community shortly.}

        abstract = {Progress in multimedia capture, analysis, and delivery, combined with the rapid adoption of broadband communication, have resulted in educational multimedia systems that have advanced traditional forms of teaching and learning. New trends in technology, such as mobile multimedia or advanced approaches for the automatic analysis of multimodal signals, offer novel and exciting opportunities for teaching and learning. However, many scientists have stopped working on the topic because they were disappointed with mediocre results that seemed to have no impact. In this article, we investigate the reasons for this and argue that the question of how multimedia can really make education more exploratory and enjoyable is as yet unanswered, and we are just beginning to understand the real contribution of multimedia to education. Based on a brief overview of the history of educational multimedia systems and a rough analysis of the current situation, we venture a glimpse into the future and argue that educational multimedia is (still) a vivid and relevant area for research.}

This paper introduces prefetching and caching enhancements for an existing SOA framework for mobile applications to reduce the user perceived latency. Latency reduction is achieved by proactively sending data to the mobile device that could most likely be requested at a later time. This additional data is piggybacked onto responses to actual requests and injected into a client side cache, so that it can be used without an additional connection. The prefetching is done automatically using a sequence prediction algorithm. The benefit of prefetching and caching enhancements were evaluated for different network settings and a reduction of user perceived latency of up to 31\% was found in a typical scenario.

This estimation helps to interpret the move- ment signal, which is of interest for augmented piano and piano pedagogy applications.},

In this paper, we present AUGUR, a system that provides context-aware interaction support for navigating and entering data in arbitrary form-based web applications. We further report the results of an initial user study we performed to evaluate the usability of such context-aware interaction support.  AUGUR combines several novel approaches: (i) it considers various context sources for providing interaction support, and (ii) it contains a context store that mimics the user's short-term memory to keep track of the context information that currently influences the user's interactions. AUGUR thereby combines the advantages of the three main approaches for supporting the user's interactions, i.e. knowledge-based systems, learning agents, and end-user programming.},

Bayesian trust models provide a well-founded way for deriving trust from evidence.

We propose a modification of the Bayesian approach that integrates context-dependent parameters in the prior knowledge and that allows to overcome the negative effects that are usually introduced with aging. Furthermore, we propose a mapping of this approach to a more intuitive representation of trust.}

Interactive spaces feature a large and dynamically changing number of devices, e.g., an interactive TV set in the living room that is used with different input devices or an iPhone that is dynamically federated to devices in the environment. Web applications need a better way to exploit the resources in the interactive space beyond the standard input devices like mouse and keyboard, e.g., a speech recognition device. This paper presents MundoMonkey a web browser extension and programming API for interactive spaces. The API follows the event based programming paradigm for allowing web applications and end-user scripts to access the interactive space. Our approach aligns well with the commonly used programming style for web applications. We used MundoMonkey to customize the interface of web applications to user preferences and the interactive space at hand. To our knowledge our approach is the first to address adaptation of the output as well as processing of input data. With MundoMonkey the customization is performed transparently to the application developer by the end-user. Thereby, MundoMonkey is an alternative to model driven user interface development approaches.}

This helps both in analyzing existing work practices and interfaces and in guiding the design of interfaces which offer complex functionality and nevertheless remain simple to use. Second, we apply this framework and contribute three novel pen-and-paper interaction strategies for creating hyperlinks between printed and digital documents and for tagging both types of documents.},

        abstract = {Discovering and unlocking the full potential of complex pervasive environments is still approached in application-centric ways. A set of statically deployed applications often defines the possible interactions within the environment. However, the increasing dynamics of such environments require a more versatile and generic approach which allows the end-user to inspect, configure and control the overall behavior of such an environment. A meta-UI addresses these needs by providing the end-user with an interactive view on a physical or virtual environment which can then be observed and manipulated at runtime. The meta-UI bridges the gap between the resource providers and the end-users by abstracting a resource?s features as executable activities that can be assembled at runtime to reach a common goal. In order to allow software services to automatically integrate with a pervasive computing environment, the minimal requirements of the environment?s meta-UI must be identified and agreed on. In this paper we present Meta-STUD, a goaland service-oriented reference framework that supports the creation of meta-UIs for usage in pervasive environments. The framework is validated using two independent implementation approaches designed with different technologies and focuses.},

        abstract = {As users get accustomed to an increasing diverse range of mobile devices, personal computers, intelligent home and office appliances, as well as shared public devices, collaborative multi-device systems are emerging to benefit from using together devices of different users and different capabilities. This paper presents a conceptual framework for the systematic design of such systems in symbiotic environments. It distinguishes between information and interaction spaces. Focusing on using devices together, we introduce relationships between interaction spaces and annotatable mappings between the information space and the interaction spaces. Customizable annotations and the corresponding transformation of information support the development of collaborative systems for different scenarios. To demonstrate the validity of our framework, we introduce an architecture for multi-device web-browsing systems, and an annotation vocabulary which particularly focuses on symbiotic environments. The evaluation of our implemented prototype confirms the usefulness of multi-browsing, and the need for supporting both developers and end users to individually annotate web pages.},

Future ambient intelligent infrastructures must be able to configure themselves and grow from the available, purposeful objects (be it software services or consumer appliances) in order to become effective in the real world. This workshop refers to Smart Products as real-world objects, devices and software services bundled with knowledge about themselves and the ability to gather knowledge from their environment and other products. This vision enables new ways of narrowing the differences between virtual and physical worlds by defining a paradigm where both virtual and physical entities can seamlessly integrate their capabilities with people.The research areas involved are many, including Ambient Intelligence, Product Engineering, Distributed Systems, Human Computer Interaction, Economics, Artificial Intelligence, and many more. This workshop brings together different areas of expertise to help us shape a vision of creating living and working environments out of Smart Products.},

We show equivalence between graph kernels and the recent MMMF extensions by Mnih and Salakhutdinov (Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 20, 2008). Experimental evaluation of the introduced extensions show improved performance over the original MMMF formulation.},

        abstract = {Searching in P2P networks is fundamental to all overlay networks. P2P networks based on Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) are optimized for single key lookups, whereas unstructured networks offer more complex queries at the cost of increased traffic and uncertain success rates. Our Distributed Tree Construction (DTC) approach enables structured P2P networks to perform prefix search, range queries, and multicast in an optimal way. It achieves this by creating a spanning tree over the peers in the search area, using only information available locally on each peer. Because DTC creates a spanning tree, it can query all the peers in the search area with a minimal number of messages. Furthermore, we show that the tree depth has the same upper bound as a regular DHT lookup which in turn guarantees fast and responsive runtime behavior. By placing objects with a region quadtree, we can perform a prefix search or a range query in a freely selectable area of the DHT. Our DTC algorithm is DHT-agnostic and works with most existing DHTs. We evaluate the performance of DTC over several DHTs by comparing the performance to existing application-level multicast solutions, we show that DTC sends 30?250\% fewer messages than common solutions.}

In addition we implemented a user-friendly movement and environment simulator which interacts with the network layer on top of the simulated movement. The chosen data structure have proven to be well suited for describing settings and actions found in a first response scenario. The simulator combines movement and network simulation and therefore enables both, fine grained movement models and location aware network models with reciprocal interdependencies. The simulation results of the chosen communication approach are therefore more fine grained than using a network or movement simulator separately.},

Often, the only ones to understand the matter and complexity of these processes are the people, who actually execute them. This raises the need for novel business process management approaches, which can enable business users to proactively express process knowledge and to participate in the business process management and design according to their actual expertise and problem solving strategies. The presented paper describes an architecture, which supports a framework for end user-driven composition and management of underspecified, human-centric business processes. The solution builds up on email-integrated task management and enables dynamic generation of decentralized-emerging process structures through web service-based activity tracking. The captured process execution examples are shared in central enterprise repositories for further adaptation and reuse. This enables \&quot;seeding, evolutionary growth, and reseeding\&quot; of user-defined, weakly-structured process models towards global best-practice definitions.}

It consists of a belt worn PC (QBIC) for the doctor, wrist worn accelerometer for gesture recognition, a wrist worn RFID reader, a bedside display, and a PDA for the nurse. Results of evaluation of the system, including simulated (with dummy patient) ward rounds with 9 different doctors and accompanying nurses are given. The results of the evaluation have lead to a new system version aimed at deployment in real life ?production environment? (doctors and nurses performing ward rounds with real patients). The paper concludes by describing this next generation system and initial experiences from a first two week test deployment in a real life hospital setting.}

        abstract = {Ubiquitous Computing assumes that users and their computing devices are highly mobile. Because it is unlikely that mobile networks will be equally available in the same quality everywhere, there may be varying levels of connectivity, ranging from full network availability through low-bandwidth connectiv- ity, to no connection at all. As a consequence, software components in the system cannot assume that the connections between them are static and always available. The event-based style is essential for ubiquitous computing, since it offers a good decoupling of the communicating entities in terms of space, time, and program flow. This chapter starts with an introduction to the different interaction models found in distributed systems. Next, a classification of publish/subscribe-systems is presented. We then describe a formal data and filter model that allows us to precisely define the semantics of event filters. Based on this model, we discuss different routing algorithms for the efficient distribution of event notifications in a network. Finally, a number of examples for publish/subscribe systems are presented.},

Devices are getting cheaper, become easier to use, and wireless network interfaces enable communications. However, the \&quot;smartness\&quot;, such as autonomic behavior, personalization and cooperation capabilities of these devices is still rather limited. Compared to the notion of appliances investigated in UC twenty years ago, which has brought several important base technologies, Smart Products aim to add such smart behavior.},

Web services are one incarnation of SOA. This chapter gives a brief introduction to SOA. It discusses the attributes that define SOA, the roles of the participants in a service oriented environment. The essence of SOA is that clients use services offered by a service provider to get a task done. For the moment we simplify service to \&quot;a software component with network connection\&quot;. Services are offered with a description at well-known \&quot;places\&quot; (also called registries, repositories), where clients choose services according to their needs. The chapter discusses several approaches to describe services and to look for them. Moreover, some well-known systems, and also current research, are discussed.},

        abstract = {Efficient communication architectures are vital for handling larger scale first response scenarios, and existing mechanisms have several shortcomings due to the heterogeneity of first response groups. In this paper, we consider using peer-to-peer-based communication architectures for first response scenarios. We evaluated different network overlays in environments found in first response -like scenarios. A first response P2P system needs to address both, reliability in high churn situations in network infrastructure mode as well as reasonable usability in wireless ad-hoc networks. Our evaluation shows that a superpeer architecture based on peer capabilities has superior performance when compared with purely unstructured or DHT-based overlays.}

The  two  different  types  of  touches are   sonified   by  different   instrument   sounds.   This   gives   the player an increased awareness of his elbow movements, which is considered  valuable for  piano  education.

Therefore, additional data channels can potentially be valuable for future piano teaching systems. In this paper we have examined the question, if inertial measurement sensors attached to the piano student?s arm can provide information that could be relevant for a piano teaching system. Therefore, we have attached a prototypical sensor that provides accelerometer and gyroscope data to the arm of a pianist. The pianist performed different piano playing patterns such as rotation of the forearm, tremoli, trills, scales, jumps, vertical forearm motion, repetition, octave repetition and connection of loud and soft notes. We show that these playing patterns can be distinguished based on the data from our sensor. Using this  technique,  a piano teaching system could also be able to assess the piano student?s arm motions.}

SYSSOMO uses scorefollowing to synchronize two performances of the same piece in order to overlay motion data, MIDI, and video. Using this technique, the user can easily compare the differences between the performances of a teacher and a student. To capture arm movement, sensors have to be unobtrusive for good user acceptance, and lightweight to minimize independent movement of the sensor. We have developed and built sensing hardware, called MotionNet, to capture arm movements. MotionNet is composed of a set of sensor units and a host unit, which communicate via CAN. This architecture helps us to reduce size and weight of the sensor units.}

This work examines the performance of a profile-based data dissemination scheme. We use a 2- step simulation approach which combines realistic user mobility traces with synthetic mobility models. We consider different system configurations and evaluate their effects on the data dissemination scheme. In particular, we look at how different wireless networking technologies affect the system and how much can we benefit from the installation of fixed information sprinkler nodes. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of user behavior by comparing selfish and generous users. Our results clearly demonstrate that realistic user mobility patterns result in a feasible opportunistic data dissemination scheme. In most of the studies scenarios, the effectiveness of the dissemination is very high, with over 90\% of the users reached within a week of real time. Our results on user behavior show that although the effects of selfish behavior can be mitigated, they cannot be completely eliminated.}

        abstract = {Ad hoc networks and peer-to-peer systems typically require many users to participate, to leverage the full benefits of the system. In this paper we consider incentives for opportunistic networks. As an example, consider an electronic coupon system, where providers send out coupons, which are passed from user to user. Users receive bonus points for each redemption to encourage participation. We define a general model for such bonus point -based coupon schemes and derive an optimal strategy to allow a user to determine how many bonus points she should ask for when passing the coupon. We also show that our optimal strategy is very robust against all other user strategies, and that there is a strong incentive for users to follow our optimal strategy.},

        abstract = {The notion of Ambient Intelligence was introduced to describe a scenario in which, literally, computing is everywhere. This should not be taken in the narrow-minded sense of a computer on every desk, but in the rather subtler one of computers becoming embedded in everyday objects and augmenting them with information processing capabilities. Part of this vision is already becoming a reality, as tagging everyday objects with sensors, actuators and building an instrumented environment are recent practices in industry and academia. In fact, the smart object domain has matured over the years. The combination of Internet and technologies like near ?eld communications, real time localization, sensor networking etc. are bringing smart objects into commercial use. However, there are still many open issues that need to be addressed to bring smart objects out of the living lab prototypes. In this position paper after laying out our understanding of smart objects, we present three research challenges for the proliferation of smart objects that we believe will instigate stimulating discussions in the workshop.}

        abstract = {Over the past few years, several technological advances have been made to enable locating people in indoor settings, where way finding is something we do on a daily basis. In a similar way as it happened with GPS and today?s popular outdoor navigation systems, indoor navigation is set to become one of the first, truly ubiquitous services that will make our living and working environments intelligent. Two critical characteristics of human way finding are destination choice and path selection. This work focuses on the latter, which traditionally has been assumed to be the result of minimizing procedures such as selecting the shortest path, the quickest or the least costly path. However, this path approximations are not necessarily the most natural paths. Taking advantage of context-aware information sources, this paper presents an easy to deploy context-aware indoor navigation system, together with an efficient spatial representation, and novel approach for path adaptation to help people find their destination according to their preferences and contextual information. We tested our system in one building with several users to estimate first an assessment of preference values, and later to compare how the paths suggested by our system correspond to those people would actually follow. The positive results of this evaluation confirm the suitability of our models and algorithms.}

In the following, a brief history of ubiquitous computing (UC) is given first, concentrating on selected facts considered as necessary background for understanding the rest of the book. Some terms and a few important standards are subsequently mentioned that are considered necessary for understanding related literature. For traditional standards like those widespread in the computer networks world, at least superficial knowledge must be assumed since their coverage is impractical for a field with such diverse roots as UC. In the last part of this chapter, we will discuss two kinds of reference architectures, explain why they are important for the furthering of Ubiquitous Computing and for the reader?s understanding, and briefly sketch a few of these architectures by way of example.},

Digital Paper Bookmarks and tag buttons are means for the efficient semantic structuring, indexing and tagging of paper documents. We then detail on results of an ethnographic study on learning group meetings. These demonstrate that printed and digital documents form one single ecology and that personal interactions go in hand with manipulating documents.

We therefore use digital pens, which equally capture physical handwriting on real paper and act as an input device on a specific screen prototype. Links and tags can have variable scopes ranging from small document passages to a collection of several documents. Physical folders along with camera-based marker tracking provide for the tangible definition of document collections. Tags are intuitively defined on a paper tag menu card. We present two visualizations of links and tags (a document-centered viewer and a hyperstructure-centered graph view). These are closely coupled with the physical environment.},

However, such tailoring requires not only the users? domain expertise but also advanced skills in computer use, which business users mostly lack. The paper presents the design of the Collaborative Task Manager (CTM) prototype which overcomes this limitation and enables end users to become informed participants in business process composition. CTM uses enterprise-wide ?programming by example? by exposing common functionalities for personal task management to the end users and tracking their activities to generate end-to-end process execution examples on a central instance. These can be adapted and reused for ad-hoc process support or exported to formal process models, which enables tailoring as collaboration between business users, end-user tailors and developers. The paper finally reports on trial usage of the tool at a partner company.},

        abstract = {Enterprises face the challenge of managing underspecified, human-centric business processes, which are executed in distributed teams in a rather informal, ad-hoc manner. This gave hibernating CSCW and ad-hoc workflow research a new push recently. However, there is still the need to clearly perceive end users as the actual drivers of business processes and to enable them to proactively tailor these processes according to their actual expertise and problem solving strategies. This paper presents the design and evaluation of a prototype for end-user development of weakly-structured process models through email-integrated task management. The presented CTM (Collaborative Task Manager) prototype uses \&quot;programming by example\&quot; to leverage user experience with standard email and task management applications and to extend user skills towards the definition of reusable process structures. By closely correlating to the actual user work practices and software environment, the tool provides a \&quot;gentle slope of complexity\&quot; for end users engaging in process tailoring activities.}

This can facilitate the elaboration of consistent process models which are better turned to users? needs and organizational changes. Despite the variety of tools and notations, process modeling remains hardly accessible for business users, who lack advanced technical skills. This paper presents an integrated approach for end-user driven business process modeling which uses web service based activity tracking to generate weakly-structured process models by capturing data on personal task management. These models can be adapted and reused for ad-hoc process support or exported to formal workflows by delivering the business knowledge to process designers and software developers. Interconnection of ad-hoc and formal workflows results in enhanced process flexibility and allows complementation of formal workflows through deviations at runtime. The approach is validated through the Collaborative Task Management (CTM) prototype.}

        abstract = {We present a flexible approach to collaborative filtering which stems from basic research results. The approach is flexible in several dimensions: We introduce an algorithm where the loss can be tailored to a particular recommender problem. This allows us to optimize the prediction quality in a way that matters for the specific recommender system. The introduced algorithm can deal with structured estimation of the predictions for one user. The most prominent outcome of this is the ability of learning to rank items along user preferences. To this end, we also present a novel algorithm to compute the ordinal loss in O(n log(n)) as apposed to O(n2). We extend this basic model such that it can accommodate user and item offsets as well as user and item features if they are present. The latter unifies collaborative filtering with content based filtering. We present an analysis of the algorithm which shows desirable properties in terms of privacy needs of users, parallelization of the algorithm as well as collaborative filtering as a service. We evaluate the algorithm on data provided by WikiLens. This data is a cross-domain data set as it contains ratings on items from a vast array of categories. Evaluation shows that cross- domain prediction is possible.}

More precisely, we calculate the correlation networks, which are unweighted and undirected graphs, from microarray data of cervical cancer whereas each network represents a tissue of a certain tumor stage and each node in the network represents a gene. From these networks we extract one tree for each gene by a local decomposition of the correlation network. The interpretation of a tree is that it represents the n-nearest neighbor genes on the n?th level of a tree, measured by the Dijkstra distance, and, hence, gives the local embedding of a gene within the correlation network. For the obtained trees we measure the pairwise similarity between trees rooted by the same gene from normal to cancerous tissues. This evaluates the modification of the tree topology due to progression of the tumor. Finally, we rank the obtained similarity values from all tissue comparisons and select the top ranked genes. For these genes the local neighborhood in the correlation networks changes most between normal and cancerous tissues. As a result we find that the top ranked genes are candidates suspected to be involved in tumor growth and, hence, indicates that our method captures essential information from the underlying DNA microarray data of cervical cancer.},

This process is supported by a set of common services and tools for modelling, inspection, debugging, testing, and rapid prototyping. We describe how these tools are applied in certain phases to support the process.},

In the case of ambient media, the humans? natural environment becomes to the ?enveloping media? as an environment in which content functions. This work therefore deals with the development of ambient media, far beyond seeing TV as a major entertainment platform in consumers? homes. To satisfy the entertainment-hungry consumer, more and more advanced home entertainment (HE) systems and facilities are required to provide interactive and smart leisure content. This chapter glimpses the future of modern ambient HE systems. Experts in the field of ambient media discuss and contribute to four major lines of the future development of ambient media: (1) social implications, (2) converging media, (3) consumer content, and (4) smart devices.},

An evaluation of a prototype system was performed with a group of doctors and nurses, who physically tried out the system in a simulated ward round scenario and were interviewed about their experiences. Generally, the doctors and nurses felt such system would be helpful in diminishing paper work and enhance collaboration. The most critical component of the prototype system was the navigation in electronic patient documents using gesture interaction. The doctors found the gestures difficult to learn and were worried the patient contact would suffer as a result of too much attention being needed by the gestures.}

While not neglecting the technical basis, it provides the 	necessary abstractions needed for risk or emergency management of 	critical infrastructures in a complex environment. ISE supports an 	iterative modelling approach that allows ongoing refinement steps 	based on the analysis of the current model. This iterative approach 	is able to minimise some of the existing problems commonly found 	in critical infrastructure modelling and simulation. By focusing 	on the services provided by critical infrastructures it is possible 	to bridge the gap between the business view and the engineering view 	on critical infrastructures. The technical realisation of services 	is described in the implementation layer; the effects of the successful 	or unsuccessful delivery of services are described using the effect 	layer. A sound mathematical foundation provides the basis for all 	kinds of analysis starting with topological analysis of the dependency 	structures up to statistical analysis of results obtained by the 	simulation of complex agent-based models.}

        abstract = {Students in Computational Linguistics often lack experience in building robust and scalable software components. Thus, student projects tend to be unstable and to work only under very special preconditions (e.g., a project has to be installed in a certain directory, or handles only single files instead of whole directories). Furthermore, if students have to build a system from scratch, they have to concentrate on input and output issues, as well as connecting numerous preprocessing components that were not designed to work together. This limits the scope of feasible course tasks to relatively simple ones like implementing yet another tokenizer. When offering the course ?Unstructured Information Management: Theory and Applications 1 as part of the B.A./M.A. program of International Studies in Computational Linguistics at the University of T\&uuml;bingen, our motivation was to familiarize students with fundamental concepts in unstructured information management and Natural Language Processing (NLP) middleware. This should enable students of computational linguistics to work on more challenging tasks, and to gain first experiences with building complex software systems. The course goals were supported by providing basic preprocessing components like a tokenizer or a PoSTagger on the basis of the Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) (Ferrucci and Lally, 2004). Thus, students of computational linguistics can concentrate on their core competence and work on more challenging tasks both in terms of theoretical complex- 1http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/teaching/ ws0607/UIMseminar ity and industrial relevance. As a side effect, components developed in the course are robust and scalable, which enables re-use by the research community.2 UIMA allows us to shift the focus from software engineering to research relevant tasks, like thorough evaluation of the projects.}

A key feature of CertainTrust is that it is capable of expressing 	the certainty of a trust opinion, depending on the context of use. 	We show how the trust values can be expressed using different representations 	(one for users and one for software agents) and present an automatic 	mapping to change between the representations.}

Instead, we present the benefit of our layered solution that creates a model-based representation of any popular slide-based presentation format like PowerPoint and PDF and uses the original presentation systems that run in parallel to our own application, the universal presentation controller. Therefore, we can keep all hot features like integrated audios or videos, animations and slide transitions, notes and even native inking of the original presentation systems, but are also able to add our own extensions in general. We can communicate with other applications and offer them access to our model and core functionality. The models can be modified and extended online, which for example allows the integration of snapshots taken from a webcam.},

        abstract = {As a report of a working group at ITiCSE 2006, this paper provides a vision of how visualizations and the software that generates them may be integrated into hypertextbooks and course management systems. This integration generates a unique synergy that we call a Visualization-based Computer Science Hypertextbook (VizCoSH). By borrowing features of both traditional hypertextbooks and course management systems, VizCoSHs become delivery platforms that address some of the reasons why visualizations have failed to find widespread use in education. The heart of the paper describes these features and explains, from both a student and teacher perspective, how each feature adds educational value to a visualization. In some cases, this value focuses on pedagogical issues, taking advantage of known strategies for making visualizations more engaging and effective. In other cases, the emphasis is on making it easier for teachers to use visualizations. A set of possible use scenarios and approaches for increasing interest in adopting a VizCoSH are also presented.}

Our last paper served to present the technical basis of our concept for the development of an open architecture and is recommended to be read, since we now present the results and benefits of its application in the classroom 1. We will examine not only the benefits for lecturers and learners, but also provide examples that illustrate our contributions for developers and supporters. The discussion of our results will be assisted by the presentation of features, use-cases and selected results of our continuously performed evaluation. All of them will be used to demonstrate the advantage and the power of our contribution that enabled us to adopt valuable features of other systems, to integrate completely new features and to combine our systems even with external ones.}

IRRIIS will 	increase dependability, survivability and resilience of EU ICT-based 	critical information infrastructures and has the objectives to: 	 	 	 * determine a sound set of public and private sector requirements 	based upon scenario and related data analysis; 	 	 * design, develop, integrate and test MIT components suitable for 	preventing and limiting cascading effects and supporting automated 	recovery and service continuity in critical situations; 	 	 * develop, integrate, and validate novel and advanced modelling and 	simulation tools integrated into a synthetic environment for experiments 	and exercises; 	 	 * validate the functions of the MIT components using the synthetic 	environment and the results of the scenario and data analysis; 	 	 * disseminate novel and innovative concepts, results, and products 	to other ICT-based critical sectors. 	 	 	IRRIIS will address the challenges of CIIP by a "diagnosis - therapy 	strategy" and "therapy implementation and validation approach" starting 	with the electrical power infrastructure and its supporting telecommunication 	infrastructure. After thoroughly analysing these infrastructures 	and their interdependencies, the synthetic simulation environment 	(SYNTEX) will be build. MIT components will be developed, tested 	and validated inside SYNTEX to demonstrate their capabilities before 	dissemination to potential stakeholders. The approach is open for 	successively including additional critical infrastructures. 	 	The interdisciplinary research will be performed in the coming three 	years by a European consortium of fifteen partners, ranging from 	academia to key stakeholders from the fields of energy supply and 	telecommunication. The project is supported by the European Union 	Sixth Framework Programme within the area of "Information Society 	Technologies" with seven million Euro funding and it is co ordinated 	by Fraunhofer Institut Autonome intelligente Systeme (AIS).}

It has to reach the ball under 	certain conditions to be able to kick it towards a given target. 	In order to kick, the ball has to be in front of the robot. The robot 	also has to reach the ball at a certain angle in relation to the 	target, because the ball is always kicked in the direction from the 	center of the robot to the ball. The robot learns which velocity 	differences should be applied to the wheels: one of the wheels is 	set to the maximum velocity, the other one according to this difference.We 	apply a REINFORCE algorithm [1] in combination with some kind of 	extended Growing Neural Gas (GNG) [2] to learn these continuous actions. 	The resulting algorithm, called ReinforceGNG, is tested in a simulated 	environment with and without noise.},

Local models are built interpolating between 	values associated with the map\&\#039;s neurons. These models are combined 	using a weighted sum to yield the final approximation value. The 	values, the positions, and the "local ranges" of the neurons are 	adapted to improve the approximation quality.

        abstract = {Because Internet access rates are highly heterogeneous, many video content providers today make available different versions of the videos, with each version encoded at a different rate. Multiple video versions, however, require more server storage and may also dramatically impact cache performance in a traditional cache or in a CDN server. An alternative to versions is layered encoding, which can also provide multiple quality levels. Layered encoding requires less server storage capacity and may be more suitable for caching; but it typically increases transmission bandwidth due to encoding overhead. In this paper we compare video streaming of multiple versions with that of multiple layers in a caching environment.We examine caching and distribution strategies that use both versions and layers. We consider two cases: the request distribution for the videos is known a priori; and adaptive caching, for which the request distribution is unknown. Our analytical and simulation results indicate that mixed distribution/caching strategies provide the best overall performance.},

More precisely, we calculate the correlation networks, which are unweighted and undirected graphs, from microarray data of cervical cancer whereas each network represents a tissue of a certain tumor stage and each node in the network represents a gene. From these networks we extract one tree for each gene by a local decomposition of the correlation network. The interpretation of a tree is that it represents the n-nearest neighbor genes on the n?th level of a tree, measured by the Dijkstra distance, and, hence, gives the local embedding of a gene within the correlation network. For the obtained trees we measure the pairwise similarity between trees rooted by the same gene from normal to cancerous tissues. This evaluates the modification of the tree topology due to progression of the tumor. Finally, we rank the obtained similarity values from all tissue comparisons and select the top ranked genes. For these genes the local neighborhood in the correlation networks changes most between normal and cancerous tissues. As a result we find that the top ranked genes are candidates suspected to be involved in tumor growth and, hence, indicates that our method captures essential information from the underlying DNA microarray data of cervical cancer.},

Thereby, the task of clustering web-based document structures has many applications, e.g., improving information retrieval on the web, better understanding of user navigation behavior, improving web users requests servicing, and increasing web information accessibility. In this paper we investigate a new approach for clustering web-based hypertexts on the basis of their graph structures. The hypertexts will be represented as so called generalized trees which are more general than usual directed rooted trees, e.g., DOM-Trees. As a important preprocessing step we measure the structural similarity between the generalized trees on the basis of a similarity measure d. Then, we apply agglomerative clustering to the obtained similarity matrix in order to create clusters of hypertext graph patterns representing navigation structures. In the present paper we will run our approach on a data set of hypertext structures and obtain good results in Web Structure Mining. Furthermore we outline the application of our approach in Web Usage Mining as future work.},

To obtain an objective quality measure for this influence we simulate gene expression values with a biologically plausible model of a known network structure. Within this framework we study the influence of single gene knock-outs in opposite to linearly controlled expression for single genes on the quality of the infered network structure.},

The purpose of our simulations is to gain insights in the experimental design of microarray experiments to infer, e.g., transcription regulatory networks from microarray experiments. Here external noise means, that the dynamics of the system under investigation, e.g., temporal changes of mRNA concentration, is affected by measurement errors. Additionally to external noise another problem occurs in the context of microarray experiments. Practically, it is not possible to monitor the mRNA concentration over an arbitrary long time period as demanded by the statistical methods used to learn the underlying network structure. For this reason, we use only short time series to make our simulations more biologically plausible.},

This classifier is based on a local decomposition of the graph for each node in generalized trees. The obtained trees, forming the tree set of the graph, are then pairwise compared by a generalized treesimilarity- algorithm (GTSA) and the resulting similarity scores determine a characteristic similarity distribution of the graph. Classification in this context is defined as mutual consistency for all pure and mixed tree sets and their resulting similarity distributions in a graph class. We demonstrate the application of this method to an artificially generated data set and for data from microarray experiments of cervical cancer.}

A general function approximator ? Locally Weighted Interpolating 	Growing Neural Gas (LWIGNG) ? is developed from Growing Neural Gas 	(GNG). The topological neighbourhood structure is used for calculating 	interpolations between neighbouring neurons and for applying a local 	weighting scheme. The capabilities of this method are shown in several 	experiments, with special considerations given to changing target 	functions and changing input distributions. 	 	 	2. To learn discrete actions LWIGNG is combined with Q-Learning forming 	the Q-LWIGNG method. The underlying GNG-algorithm has to be changed 	to take care of the special order of the input data in action learning. 	Q-LWIGNG achieves very good results in experiments with the pole 	balancing and the mountain car problems, and good results with the 	acrobot problem. 	 	 	3. To learn continuous actions a REINFORCE algorithm is combined with 	LWIGNG forming the ReinforceGNG method. An actor-critic architecture 	is used for learning from delayed rewards. LWIGNG approximates both 	the state-value function and the policy. The policy is given by the 	situation dependent parameters of a normal distribution. ReinforceGNG 	is applied successfully to learn continuous actions of a simulated 	2-wheeled robot which has to intercept a rolling ball under certain 	conditions.},

           title = {Team Description Mainz Rolling Brains 2005},
        abstract = {This year we will introduce a whole new decision layer design based on gen- eral principles for coordinated multiagent decision making. In last year's Mainz Rolling Brains 3D agent [1] we used the same agent design as in our 2D agent [2\{4]. On the decision layer we had several modules for different tasks as passing or dribbling. These modules rated the usefulness of their particular actions de- pending on the current situation. Then the module with the highest rating was called to execute its action. We identified two main problems with this approach: First, the coordination between these modules turned out to be quite difficult. To obtain a different agent behavior, changes in several modules were necessary. Also, it was not very clear which module is used in which situation. Second, the switch from 2D to 3D simulation means a considerable increase in the complexity of the agent control. In particular, the handling of the ball got a lot more difficult than before and so now an additional couple of steps is necessary to accomplish the basic tasks as passing or dribbling. This has far reaching consequences. For example, in 2D it was sufficient to think about the pass partner when the agent was in the position to kick the ball because it could kick in every direction quickly. In 3D the agent has to choose its pass partner many simulation cycles before it reaches the ball because it can only kick in the direction from the agent towards the ball. So, in order to play a pass towards a teammate, it has to approach the ball in a certain way. While approaching the ball, the pass partner may also change its position which would make further adaptations necessary. Our answer to these problems is to introduce new methods for making de- cisions and executing actions. The basic idea is to use team actions which are valid for the whole team and facilitate the coordination of the agents. Based on these team actions we will have a clear structure for choosing the appropriate individual actions using explicit goal functions which rate the usefulness of the outcomes of the team actions. This general approach to coordinated multiagent decision making is described in the next section. In section 3 we will give a short overview of the overall agent design and give some hints how the general approach is realized in the decision layer. Section 4 deals with the learning of a simple skill: a simulated two-wheeled robot learns to approach a moving ball in order to kick it towards a given target. We conclude with section 5 where we sum up the current status and describe our plans for the future.},

        abstract = {One of the focus areas of our ubiquitous computing research is context aware support for people on the move, in particular for mobile workers who need hands and eyes free. \&quot;Mobile\&quot; here refers to everything except \&quot;sitting at a PC\&quot;: it includes, e.g., workers at assembly lines or in laboratories. In order to understand our focus, one may imagine an employee carrying out a manual activity as part of her job description; further, one has to imagine an environment equipped with smart items (tags, sensors, ?). Based on process models, enterprise integration software, and the context awareness provided, applications can i) \&quot;understand\&quot; the employees? tasks, actions, and needs; and ii) deliver appropriate information / instructions to their local device. As such an application can probably never foresee the needs of the user with 100\% accuracy, a mixed initiative approach is desirable, where the user can at any time access arbitrary pertinent information in a kind of \&quot;audio browsing\&quot; mode, see below. In fact, our prototypes put the users in control of the interface as much as possible. Our studies have shown that audio support would be the preferred solution over the often-cited augmented reality, head-mounted display based support, for many application areas today.},

        abstract = {This paper presents a method of modeling on-chip communication behavior of a system as a set of communicating processes to find an optimal bus width and interface buffer size for the communication bus. An assumption for the modeling is that the system has already been partitioned and mapped onto the appropriate components of a SoC. We parameterize the communication behavior of a mixed Hw/Sw system considering the amount of data to be transferred, on-chip bus width, computation time of synthesized hardwares, bus topology and bus protocol. With these parameters we estimate the transition probabilities between the communicating processes and model the overall communication behavior of a system by Markov chain. This model is used to estimate the round trip communication delay and buffer size in the bus-interfaces for 	different bus widths. From the estimated figures we select the optimal values for those parameters that satisfy given design constraints. The results of applying this approach to an Ogg Vorbis decoder clearly demonstrate the utility of our techniques for modeling communication behavior in order	to estimate the bus width and buffer requirements of a complex system.},

Using gesture recognition and tempo adjustment algorithms, the system plays back an audio and video recording of an actual orchestra that follows the user's conducting in real time. A major achievement of this system is its ability to vary playback speed in real time while avoiding audio artifacts such as pitch changes. The system has been deployed as an exhibit and has become a major attraction of a large Vienna-based music exhibition center.},

All current languages have in common that the target device for the concrete user interface is assumed to be a single selfcontained device. But what about ubiquitous computing environments, which are generously equipped with large number of publicly available devices that are associated on demand by users who roam among devices? In this case the set of devices currently near the user forms a virtual target device. This virtual device can have unusual properties. For example, it can have more than one screen. It also changes when the user moves in or out of context of a device. We explore how current XML-based single authoring languages can be extended to support such scenarios.},

        abstract = {The Mainz Rolling Brains attend to the RoboCup Simulation League since 1998. Besides the changes in the SoccerServer since that time, our overall three-layer agent design (technical layer, transformation layer, decision layer, for details see [MRB00b]) remained roughly the same. Notably, the concept to combine various low level actions to so-called Advanced Skills [MRB00a] has proven itself very useful. Furthermore, we could keep the flexible, but simple design of our decision layer (introduced in 2000, see [MRB00a], [MRB01b]) over the last years. Because we always had about six up to ten developers, one main concern in all design decision was to have independent modules which could be handled separately by one or two developers. That also means to have reliable mechanisms to coordinate these different modules. Since we want to carry over these concepts to the 3D world, we are going to describe the main principles in the following. For details on other issues, e.g. world model [MRB02], self-localization [MRB01a], positioning [MRB02] [MRB01a], or communication[MRB00a], please have a look at our other papers.},

We analyze the situation for a particular class of dynamic geometry, namely, shapes resulting from the linear interpolation of several base shapes. The space of weights for the linear combination can be decomposed into cells so that in each cell a particular vertex is maximal (resp. minimal) in a given direction. This cell decomposition of the weight space allows deriving bounding volumes from the weight vectors rather than the generated geometry. We present algorithms to generate the cell decomposition, to map from weights to cells, and to efficiently compute the necessary data structures. This approach to computing bounding volumes for dynamic shapes proves to be beneficial if the geometry representation is large compared to the number of base shapes.\&quot;},

The aim is to utilize categories of web sites and pages as an additional retrieval criterion. In this context, the bag-of-words model has been utilized just as HTML tags and link structures. In spite of promising results this adaptation stays in the framework of IR specific models since it neglects the content-based structuring inherent to hypertext units. This paper approaches hypertext modelling from the perspective of graphtheory. It presents an XML-based format for representing websites as hypergraphs. These hypergraphs are used to shed light on the relation of hypertext structure types and their web-based instances. We place emphasis on two characteristics of this relation: In terms of realizational ambiguity we speak of functional equivalents to the manifestation of the same structure type. In terms of polymorphism we speak of a single web unit which manifests different structure types. It is shown that polymorphism is a prevalent characteristic of web-based units. This is done by means of a categorization experiment which analyses a corpus of hypergraphs representing the structure and content of pages of conference websites. On this background we plead for a revision of text representation models by means of hypergraphs which are sensitive to the manifold structuring of web documents.},

        abstract = {During the last decade, two big efforts on Internet quality of service were made. The first, IntServ, promises precise per-flow service provisioning but never really made it as a commercial end-user product, which was mainly accredited to its lack of scalability. Its successor, DiffServ, is more scalable at the cost of coarser service granularity {--} which may be the reason why it is not yet commercially available to end users either. This leaves us with the question: is there a fundamental trade-off between QoS and scalability? A trade-off that, in the long run, could prevent deployment of QoS for end users altogether?},

We apply the contextually enhanced system to the task of scoring alternative speech recognition hypotheses (SRH) in terms of their semantic coherence. We conducted several annotation experiments and showed that human annotators can reliably differentiate between semantically coherent and incoherent speech recognition hypotheses (both with and without discourse context). We also showed, that annotators can reliably identify the overall best hypothesis from a given n-best list. While the original ONTOSCORE system correctly assigns the highest score to 84.06\% of the corpus, the inclusion of the conceptual context increases the number of correct classifications to yield 86.76\%, given a baseline of 63.91\% in both cases.},

        abstract = {As of today, only simple office applications such as calendar and email applications are widely used on mobile devices - more complex applications still lack acceptance. The limited user interface features and the more difficult data input on mobile devices demand a redesign of complex applications to meet the needs of employees on the road. Especially in the context of enterprise applications, the complexity of information presented by typical desktop applications has to be reduced to the essential amount needed in a specific mobile usage scenario. This requires that the application is aware of the user context, including the device type and the current location. By using context information, parts of an application can be automated to minimize the required amount of user interaction. This paper describes the evolution of a typical enterprise application for Sales Order Entry towards a location-aware and personalized mobile application. Our implementation bases on a real word scenario for sales force automation and incorporates recorded customer feedback from an earlier prototype implementation. The major contribution of this paper is the integration of real-time location information with enterprise backend data. We use a Geographical Information System (GIS) based mapping service to access customer data depending on a location provided by an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. We will describe the mapping between GIS and ERP data and show how this approach improves the usability of mobile applications.},

The proposed model may be used for analyzing the quality factors of mobile web applications, expert evaluation checklists and may be used for quality based content adaptation. Finally, the paper shows that challenges in mobile web application development may be solved by applying quality insurance methods to the development of those applications.}

The diploma thesis was concerned with long-distance musical interaction ("NetMusic"). This is a very peculiar application: only a small amount of bandwidth may be necessary, but timely delivery and reduced loss are very important. Back then, these require? ments led to a thorough investigation of existing telecommunication network mechanisms, but a satisfactory answer to the question could not be found. Simply put, the answer is "yes" - this work describes a mechanism which indeed enables an application to "ask for the available bandwidth". This obvi? ously does not only concern online musical collaboration any longer. Among others, the mechanism yields the following advantages over existing alterna? tives: ? good throughput while maintaining close to zero loss and a small bottleneck queue length ? usefulness for streaming media applications due to a very smooth rate ? feasibility for satellite and wireless links ? high scalability Additionally, a reusable framework for future applications that need to "ask the network" for certain performance data was developed.}

The feedback signaling is carried out using the PTP protocol which is similar to ATM ABR Explicit Rate Feedback but requires no state or exertive calculations at routers. The nonlinear endpoint control law, which is a derivation of CAPC and is implemented entirely at end systems, quickly converges to a fixed and stable point in our analysis and early simulations. Generally, our mechanism appears to be a better choice for high-speed networks than AIMD, which is based on implicit or explicit binary feedback.},

The digital lecture hall (DLH) project accommodates traditional teaching methods right on the spot - making them 'digitally' available for computer assistance - but also reaches out to a large variety of computer assisted methods and to accompanying new organizational and business models. Apart from this smooth transition yet far reach, DLH has a second focus: the attempt to exploit venues which go well beyond class room size; as opposed to known "electronic classroom" efforts which are limited to some 15 to 30 local participants, audiences without size limits are supported in DLH, with the first implementation in operation offering a seating capacity of about 150.}

Thus the team could easily be adopted to the soccerserver?s new features and some of the weak spots of our team could be eliminated. We use a three-layers concept for our agents: a technical layer (purely tech- nical matters like server communication), a transformation layer (the tools and skills a player might use) and the decision layer. The decision layer consists of various modules for different tasks (goal shot, pass, ballhandling, positioning and standard situation). These modules rate the adequateness of their respective ac- tions and compete for the control over the player. More detailed information about our team architecture can be found in [1] and [2]. One of this year?s main focuses was positioning which has been completely revised. We will describe our new position module below. We made extensive use of our new tool \&quot;FUNSSEL\&quot; (a debugging tool including an extended soccer monitor) which made it possible to further improve our technical skills and some of our modules as well. Due to the lack of space we will concentrate in the following on the new positioning module, FUNSSEL and our method of self-localisation.}

        abstract = {Most Smart Homes are created evolutionarily by adding more and more technologies to an existing home, rather than being developed on a single occasion by building a new home from scratch. This incremental addition of technology requires a highly flexible infrastructure to accommodate both future extensions and legacy systems without requiring extensive rewiring of hardware or extensive reconfiguration on the software level. Stanford?s iStuff (?Interactive Stuff?) provides an example of a hardware interface abstraction technique that enables quick customization and reconfiguration of Smart Home solutions. iStuff gains its power from its combination with the Stanford Interactive Room Operating System (iROS), which creates a flexible and robust software framework that allows custom and legacy applications to communicate with each other and with user interface devices in a dynamically configurable way. The Stanford Interactive Room (?iRoom?, see Figure 1), while not a residential environment, has many characteristics of a Smart Home: a wide array of advanced user interface technologies, abundant computation power, and infrastructure with which to coordinate the use of these resources (for more information on the iRoom or the Interactive Workspaces project, please visit http://iwork.stanford.edu). As a result, many aspects of the iRoom environment have strong implications for, and can be intuitively translated to, Smart Homes. In particular, the rapid and fluid development of physical user interfaces using iStuff and the iROS, which has been demonstrated in the iRoom, is an equally powerful concept for designing and living in Smart Homes. Before focusing on the details of iStuff, we describe the software infrastructure on which it is based, and the considerations that went into designing that infrastructure.},

Users control tempo, dynamics, and instrument emphasis of the orchestra through natural conducting gestures with an infrared baton. Using gesture recognition and tempo adjustment algorithms, the system plays back an audio and video recording of an actual orchestra that follows the user?s conducting in real time. A major achievement of this system is that it is able to play back the audio and video recording of the orchestra at variable speed while  avoiding pitch changes or other artifacts in the playback. These speed changes can be executed interactively in real time while the recording is being played back. The system has been deployed as an exhibit that has become a major attraction of a large Vienna-based music exhibition center.}

Therefore, one big point will be to enhance our team?s abilities to understand the coach language and to adjust our formation to the opponent tactics in the course of the game. Additionally, we will deal with other subjects, too. Besides the adap- tation to the new soccer server?s features, we are experimenting with learning techniques, improving our world model, and extending our visualization and debugging tool FUNSSEL for automatic execution of games (see [1] for a de- scription of FUNSSEL). The overall agent design remains the same as last year?s and is described in more detail in [3]. The agent consists of three layers: the technical layer (e.g. server communication), the transformation layer (player skills and world model) and the decision layer. The latter uses different modules for various tasks (goal shot, pass, ballhandling, positioning and standard situation) which rate the adequateness of their respective actions and are responsible for the execution of these actions.},

Multiple video versions, however, require more server storage and may also dramatically impact cache performance in a traditional cache or in a CDN server. An alternative to versions is layered encoding, which can also provide multiple quality levels. Layered encoding requires less server storage capacity and may be more suitable for caching; but it typically increases transmission bandwidth due to encoding overhead. In this paper we compare video streaming of multiple versions with that of multiple layers in a caching environment. We examine caching and distribution strategies that use both versions and layers. Our analytical results indicate that mixed distribution/ caching strategies provide the best overall performance.}

Because of the highly heterogeneous access to the Internet, researchers and engineers have argued for layered encoded video. In this paper we investigate delivering layered encoded video using caches. Based on the stochastic knapsack theory we develop a model for the layered video caching problem. We propose heuristics to determine which videos and which layers in the videos should be cached in order to maximize the revenue from the streaming service. We evaluate the performance of our heuristics through extensive numerical experiments. We find that for typical scenarios, the revenue increases nearly logarithmically with the cache size and linearly with the link bandwidth that connects the cache to the origin servers. We also consider service models with request queuing and negotiations about the delivered stream quality and find that both extensions provide only small revenue increases.}

In our model, each Internet Autonomous System (AS) is a node with finite storage capacity for replicating objects. The optimization problem is to replicate objects so that when clients fetch objects from the nearest CDN server with the requested object, the average number of ASs traversed is minimized. We formulate this problem as a combinatorial optimization problem. We show that this optimization problem is NP complete. We develop four natural heuristics and compare them numerically using real Internet topology data. We find that the best results are obtained with heuristics that have all the CDN servers cooperating in making the replication decisions. We also develop a model for studying the benefits of cooperation between nodes, which provides insight into peer-to-peer content distribution.},

For our 	simulations we extend the sugarscape model from Epstein and Axtell 	(1996) and give the agents the possibility to claim possession of 	a "plot" of land. Memes regulate the behaviour of the agents regarding 	the land claims of others. It turns out that the probability for 	the survival of the population is much higher when possession claims 	of others are respected. However, there exist short term disadvantages 	for agents respecting the possessions of others. Thus, the need for 	a possession norm arises. The introduction of sanctions provides 	a good possibility to enforce the norm as long as no costs arise 	for sanctioning agents. We also investigate different kinds of meme 	propagation and their effects on the establishment of the norm.},

In our model, each Internet Autonomous System (AS) is a node with finite storage capacity for replicating objects. The optimization problem is to replicate objects so that when clients fetch objects from the nearest CDN server with the requested object, the average number of ASs traversed is minimized. We formulate this problem as a combinatorial optimization problem. We show that this optimization problem is NP complete. We develop four natural heuristics and compare them numerically using real Internet topology data. We find that the best results are obtained with heuristics that have all the CDN servers cooperating in making the replication decisions. We also develop a model for studying the benefits of cooperation between nodes, which provides insight into peer-to-peer content distribution.}

Using both simulations and experiments with real Web servers we show that redirection schemes that require clients to retrieve different parts of a Web page from different servers yield sub-optimal performance compared to schemes where a client accesses only one server for all the parts of a Web page. This implies that when replicating Web pages, we should treat the whole page (HTML and images) as a single entity.},

Existing solutions for multimedia proxy caching are unable to adjust quality of cached streams. Thus these solutions either can not maximize delivered quality or exhibit poor caching efficiency. This paper presents the design and implementation of Mocha, a quality adaptive multimedia proxy cache for layered encoded streams. The main contribution of Mocha is its ability to adjust quality of cached streams based on their popularity and on the available bandwidth between proxy and interested clients. Thus Mocha can significantly improve caching efficiency without compromising delivered quality. To perform quality adaptive caching, Mocha implements fine-grained replacement and fine-grained prefetching mechanisms. We describe our prototype implementation of Mocha on top of Squid and address various design challenges such as managing partially cached streams. Finally, we validate our implementation and present some of our preliminary results.},

So far location information is used for typical business-to-consumer applications such as mobile MapQuest or ATM-finder. The application of location awareness in typical enterprise or business applications, such as logistics or Customer Relationship Management (CRM), is currently addressed rather poor. In this paper we discuss the enhancement of mobile enterprise applications by context information. Starting from a customer demand and for a mobile sales force scenario, our objective was the improvement of the usability of mobile enterprise applications by introducing context information to these.}

On the Internet, practically all adaptation mechanisms are based on packet loss as a sign of congestion which means that congestions actually must be caused before they can be avoided. This situation contrasts with the fact that network administrators can simply ask for information that would drastically facilitate adaptation; therefore, we introduce the Performance Transparency Protocol (PTP), which is trying to bridge that gap by making specific performance parameters available to any Internet application. This approach resembles ATMs Explicit Rate Feedback mechanism.}

While little may be blamed if one accepts this defined scope, the article puts WBT in perspective, analyzing the requirements which one might put on webbased multimedia learning systems at a second glance.

        abstract = {We propose a new design for the Domain Name System (DNS) that takes advantage of recent advances in disk storage and multicast distribution technology. In essence, our design consists of geographically distributed servers, called replicated servers, each of which having a complete and up-to-date copy of the entire DNS database. To keep the replicated servers up-to-date, they distribute new resource records over a satellite channel or over terrestrial multicast. The design allows Web sites to dynamically wander and replicate themselves without having to change their URLs. The design can also significantly improve the Web surfing experience since it significantly reduces the DNS lookup delay.}

In this paper we study how the different redirection schemes used in modern content distribution networks affect the user-perceived performance in normal Web page viewing. Using both simulations and experiments with real Web servers we show that redirection schemes that require clients to retrieve different parts of a Web page from different servers yield sub-optimal performance compared to schemes where a client accesses only one server for all the parts of a Web page. This implies that when replicating Web pages, we should treat the whole page (HTML and images) as a single entity.},

In this paper, we introduce interface patterns for hypermedia applications as a concept for reusing interface designs. The structure of this paper is as follows: first, we introduce the context in which these patterns were discovered and we give a rationale for their use. Then we present some simple but effective patterns using a standard template. We finally discuss some further issues on the use of interface patterns in hypermedia applications.}

For example, with network caching, the origin server stores a master copy of the object and geographically dispersed cache servers pull and store copies of the object. With site replication, objects stored at master are replicated into secondary sites. In this paper we propose a new network application, Location Data System (LDS), that allows an arbitrary host to obtain the IP addresses of the servers that store a specified URL. Our networking application is an extension to the Domain Name System (DNS), requires only small changes to the domain name servers, and can be deployed incrementally. For the case of network Web caching, we elaborate on our proposal to allow a cache to (i) update a distributed database when it stores or evicts objects, and (ii) push objects to parent caches in order to improve delay and bandwidth usage. For the case of mirrored servers, we show how a client can obtain a list of all servers mirroring all or part of the desired site. LDS applied to partially mirrored sites generates substantially less DNS traffic than LDS applied to caching. Finally, we discuss how a host can use the location data in order to make intelligent decisions about where to retrieve desired objects.}

We next present the main ideas underlying the Object-Oriented Hypermedia Design Method (OOHDM). We show that Web applications are built as views of conceptual models. We next present the abstraction primitives we use to design the conceptual and navigational structure of Web applications and describe the view definition language. We introduce navigational contexts as the structuring mechanism for the navigational space. Some further work on designing Web applications with OOHDM is finally presented.},

        abstract = {Huge amounts of digital video information appear on the Web. Browsing becomes a predominant issue since i) the result lists to be expected from video search engines on the Web are likely to be even less accurate than the ones we endure today in search of HTML pages; ii) the time for inspecting a single URL is expected to be even more time-consuming since we have to view time-based information i.e. viewing-over-time is the standard way of inspection; iii) the bandwidth wasted by viewing non-pertinent information tends to be by orders of magnitude larger than for HTML text. We present an approach to fast visual perception of video contents. Our flexible hierarchical 3D representation is based on an automatic ranking and colour evaluation scheme. Our Java implementation generates a set of dynamic VRML2 scenes which can be viewed using VRML2 browsers available for virtually every platform. The ranking is calculated in the compressed domain (MPEG) which results in very high performance for the video indexing portion of the system.}

In these common application scenarios, mobile agents get a task from its owner to buy certain goods. To fulfill this task, the agent wanders to various merchants and collects information about the different offers.  In this paper we present an architecture that allows mobile agents to autonomously and automatically negotiate with vendors about offers. The approach allows evaluating multiple issues of an offer, such as price, guarantee or shipping fees, by special scoring functions.  The process of negotiation in the area of electronic commerce is competitive. Thus the agent platform must avoid, that vendors can spy which tactic and strategy the mobile agents use. To ensure the relevant information for the negotiation mechanisms and functions we use a pair of cooperating agents to achieve a secret splitting.},

At the same time, however, there is a move towards autonomous software (cf. intelligent filters, mobile and distributed agents, etc.), leaving users with an uncomfortable lack of knowledge about and control over ?what these components are doing behind their backs?. Visualization of both autonomous agent action and user-agent interaction becomes a crucial issue if these conflicting trends are to be harmonized. We present a system service for comic actor animation, which can be used as a representation of agents of all kinds. A second use case is for rapid authoring of animations which augment multimedia presentations or off-the-shelf software. Our focus is on the reuse of the necessary artwork, using a modular and flexible building-block approach. As a preliminary step, this approach requires a set of elementary animation sequences to be created by a professional graphic artist,once per character. These sequences can be repeatedly combined in custom animated cartoons by easy-to-use commands at runtime. Our Comic Actor Editor Engine CAeditEngine uses a sophisticated approach for combining the elementary building blocks to form complete animations. Our Comic Actor Playing Engine CAplayEngine uses a digital chroma keying technique in combination with layering to display the animations on top of any graphical user interface and any interactive software. The system runs under MS Windows NT, a first version was used in a public interactive exhibit of multimedia and animation techniques and showed excellent performance.}

Sure, some of these advancements give raise to fears that the unprec?edented simplicity and cleanness of 00 might be sacrificed on the altars of featurism or universality. On the other hand, advancements will soon become urgently needed as the merge of computer science, telecommunications, and multimedia will greatly influence the nature of our software.

Even with sophisticated recognition and indexing techniques it remains difficult to associate human-centered, semantic content and structural informtion with it. This prohibits many desirable, more advanced interaction metaphors with the data than simple replay. We propose that a human-centered model of both multimedia data and suitable metaphors to directly and instantaneously interact with it is crucial to the design of more interactive and multimedia-aware system and application architectures. We show how we implemented such a model for the media type ?music? in the system, a highly sucessful interactive computer-based music exhibit in the Ars Electronica Center in Linz, Austria. The system uses a high-level semantic concept of musical information called Musical Design Patterns. Interaction with this representation,like spontaneous, computer-supported improvisation,is supported in a novel way using just a pair of infrared batons to control the entire exhibit. The system and its semantic model offer a technologically and artistically innovative approach that should be of interest to multimedia researchers as well as educators, artists and performers.}

        abstract = {Multimedia imposes quite a number of specific issues and requirements on software. While system support for multimedia has  been seriously investigated for several years now, the software  engineering community has not yet reached a deep understanding of the  impacts of multimedia on their field. MMSD\&\#039;96 brought together a  representative spectrum of researchers investigating this issue. Four  general observations could be retained from their contributions: 1.  distributed multimedia applications exploit both more long-term  potential and more persistent research problems than multimedia PC  applications; 2. A reference model of multimedia software is not yet  in reach; the large number of models proposed, even at MMSD, still  lack better rationales, theoretic foundation, and convergence. 3. the  MMSD community brings together people with a "document-background" and those with a "software background"; their views and approaches are  still far from being harmonized. 4. While the multimedia community  struggles for a common understanding among its members, it is in  desperate need of a harmonization with approaches to distributed  software development. In the remainder of this article, we will review  issues to be addressed in the MMSD context, discuss the contributions  made at the workshop itself, and draw conclusions for the state of the art.}

The MMSD workshop has been organized as an attempt to help jilling the gap between the availability of multimedia solutions and their customized, integrated use in the field. This introductory article positions MMSD in the range of multimedia R\&D domains, recalls the categories of contributions relevant to software development in general (solution space), describes particular characteristics of multimedia sofhvare (problem space) together with corresponding sample research contributions, and positions the contributions to the workshop in these spaces.},

In this paper, we present layout guidelines for textual and graphical, static and dynamic, 2-D and 3-D Web documents which are drawn from fields as diverse as typography, Gestalt psychology, architecture,hypertext authoring, and human-computer interaction. Web documents are classified into five basic types, and our layout rules are applied to each of these. Finally, we show how currently evolving standards (HTML 3.0 for text and still graphics, Java for 2-D animation, and VRML for 3-D worlds) support applying those rules.},

The CCF project takes an integrated approach to address  aspects ranging from interior design and information technology to software support and work organization. From a characterization of learning and working in the next century,  we develop usage scenarios, and explain our design decisions  concerning furniture, hardware, operating systems, and especially the necessary software infrastructure to support cooperation. Our initial  ?visions? are described as well as what we found was achievable under  real-world financial and technological constraints. We also outline what software support is still missing for such an  environment, and our plans to provide this support in the course of  the project. We conclude with a realistic shopping list for people who  have to manage similar projects. and exposed to a large public in the last four years. GlobeMusic and  its components mainly address the following issues: computer-human  interaction, individual eMusic-making, appropriate computer network protocols, musical data formats, and cooperative eMusic-making.

Drawing from the experiences gained during the Nestor project, jointly run between the Universities of Karlsruhe, Kaiserslautern and Freiburg and the Digital Equipment Corp. Center for Research and Advanced Development, the book presents a concrete example of new concepts in the domain of computer-aided authoring and learning. The conceptual foundation is laid by a reference architecture for an integrated environment for authoring and learning. This overall architecture represents the nucleus, shell and common denominator for the R\&D activities carried out. From its conception, the reference architecture was centered around three major issues:  Cooperation among and between authors and learners in an open, multimedia and distributed system as the most important attribute; Authoring/learning as the central topic; Laboratory as the term which evoked the most suitable association with the envisioned authoring/learning environment.  Within this framework, the book covers four major topics which denote the most important technical domains, namely:      The system kernel, based on object orientation and hypermedia;     Distributed multimedia support;     Cooperation support, and     Reusable instructional design support.  Cooperative Computer-Aided Authoring and Learning: A Systems Approach is a major contribution to the emerging field of collaborative computing and is essential reading for researchers and practitioners alike. Its pedagogic flavor also makes it suitable for use as a text for a course on the subject.},

        abstract = {Cooperative Computer-Aided Authoring and Learning: A Systems Approach describes in detail a practical system for computer assisted authoring and learning. Drawing from the experiences gained during the Nestor project, jointly run between the Universities of Karlsruhe, Kaiserslautern and Freiburg and the Digital Equipment Corp. Center for Research and Advanced Development, the book presents a concrete example of new concepts in the domain of computer-aided authoring and learning. The conceptual foundation is laid by a reference architecture for an integrated environment for authoring and learning. This overall architecture represents the nucleus, shell and common denominator for the R\&D activities carried out. From its conception, the reference architecture was centered around three major issues: 1. Cooperation among and between authors and learners in an open, multimedia and distributed system as the most important attribute; 2. Authoring/learning as the central topic; 3. Laboratory as the term which evoked the most suitable association with the envisioned authoring/learning environment. Within this framework, the book covers four major topics which denote the most important technical domains, namely: 1. The system kernel, based on object orientation and hypermedia; 2. Distributed multimedia support; 3. Cooperation support, and 4. Reusable instructional design support. Cooperative Computer-Aided Authoring and Learning: A Systems Approach is a major contribution to the emerging field of collaborative computing and is essential reading for researchers and practitioners alike. Its pedagogic flavor also makes it suitable for use as a text for a course on the subject.},

To identify how a kiosk system?s primary task influences optimal layout, kiosk systems are classified into four basic types. The usability of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) 2.0 and 3.0 to write documents for these systems is discussed, and some alternative existing environments are presented.}

We propose a comprehensive software model and an interrelated set of five graphical view types for the modeling of such complex cooperative software. A middle-out design methodology is proposed for coordinated use of the five view types, starting with a scenario-based view type called work scenario. A first version of a corresponding multi-view editor was developed. The paper concentrates on work scenario views and give an overview about the four other view types and the methodology.}

DIRECT, an example CM-OLDA which was developed using DOCASE for the most part, but 'hand?crafting' the 'CM' (cooperative work, multimedia) parts since DOCASE does not include 'CM' support. DIRECT served three purposes at the same time: evaluation of DOCASE, development of a sampie CM-OLDA, and continued requirements analysis for ITEMs.  After aperiod of experimentation with the first version of DIRECT, we think that we can give valuable input about the particular aspects of CM-OLDAs and their modeling and development.},

This demonstration will showcase DOCASE, a software engineering environment for distributed applications, using object-oriented technology. The demonstration will provide insight into the methods, languages, tools and environments used in the life-cycle of distributed applications. With the term distributed applications, we put an emphasis on structured parallelism (which comes more or less naturally with the logical structure and inherent parallelism and distribution of an application), not so much on the fine-grained parallelism exploited by applications such as image processing etc. With more and more complex (dynamic, multiparty, cooperative) distributed applications to be developed in computer integrated manufacturing, office automation, CSCW, and other domains, we think that this topic is both very much up to date and a topic which is not sufficiently taught. The live demonstration will show a distributed application which will allow researchers of arbitrary disciplines to coordinate their work with other members of a research team. The underlying meta model is generic and instantiated by developing a set of concrete object types together with a GUI.},

Deren Entwicklung in den verschiedensten Anwendungsfeldern wie Fabrik- und B{\"u}roautomatisierung ist f{\"u}r die Anwender bislang kaum zu handhaben. Neue Konzepte des Software Engineering sind daher notwendig, und zwar in den drei Bereichen ?Sprachen?, ?Werkzeuge? und ?Umgebungen?. Objekt-orientierte Methoden und graphische Unterst{\"u}tzung haben sich bei unseren Arbeiten als besonders tauglich herausgestellt, um in allen drei Bereichen deutliche Fortschritte zu erzielen. Entsprechend wurde ein universeller objektorientierter graphischer Editor, ODE, als eines unserer zentralen Basis-Werkzeuge (?tool building tool?) entwickelt. ODE basiert auf dem objekt-orientierten Paradigma sowie einer leicht handhabbaren funktionalen Sprache f{\"u}r Erweiterungen; au{\ss}erdem erlaubt ODE die einfache Integration mit anderen Werkzeugen und imperativ programmierten Funktionen. ODE entstand als Teil von DOCASE, einer Software-Produktionsumgebung f{\"u}r verteilte Anwendungen. Grundz{\"u}ge von DOCASE werden vorgestellt, Anforderungen an ODE abgeleitet. Dann wird ODE detaillierter beschrieben. Es folgt eine exemplarische Beschreibung einer Erweiterung von ODE, n{\"a}mlich der f{\"u}r die DOCASE-Entwurfssprache.},

It presents a set of recommendations for adoptions and extensions of hypermedia systems in the context of instructional tool environments (also called 'Educational Tool Environments', especially in Europe). The remainder of this chapter will explain some of the backgroundand assumptions for the paper. Then a vision will be presented of how the instructional process can be computer supported (section 2). This view fonns the context in which the further seetions of the chapter have to be seen. Seetion 3 will try to resume and c1assify the evolution of 'hyper...' systems. Recommendations will be given about how to construct a base system adhering to the 'hyper...' paradigm (3.3). This base system can be used as a generic 'virtual instructional machine' on which to build instructional tool environments. Seetion 4 will sketch an overall architecture for such an environment.}

        abstract = {Current distributed object oriented languages and systems hide distribution in general while retaining the ability to control object locations explicitly. These approaches seem adequate but are exclusively focussing on the implementation  stage of a distributed application. We present a new foundation for the development of distributed object oriented applications focussing on the design stage. Its main characteristics are: all aspects of linguistic support can be introduced, special issues, especially mobility and cooperation, can be integrated, tight integration of linguistic and CASE (Computer Aided Software  Engineering) support can be achieved, only one formalism is used throughout all of the above can be expressed at design level as opposed to source code level. In the paper, we will focus on two important aspects of distributed object oriented systems requiring special design support: mobility and cooperation (see below).}

In this respect, computer aided simulation has proved to be a very effective design tool in a number of practical applications. It is shown by the example of the MOSAIC modeling system how a simulator applicable on a broad basis could be adapted to the specific characteristics of a class of existing computer networks. The class of computer networks chosen for modeling is based on DECnet communication software. Modeling concentrates mainly on the DECnet protocols and their hierarchies. The paper indicates the adaptations necessary to adjust the MOSAIC kernel system adequately to DECnet computer networks and summarizes the results of a rather extensive validation for the modeling system, comprising calibration and accuracy establishment, which has been carried out successfully.}

        abstract = {Inference serving is of great importance in deploying machine learning models in real-world applications, ensuring efficient processing and quick responses to inference requests. However, managing resources in these systems poses significant challenges, particularly in maintaining performance under varying and unpredictable workloads. Two primary scaling strategies, horizontal and vertical scaling, offer different advantages and limitations. Horizontal scaling adds more instances to handle increased loads but can suffer from cold start issues and increased management complexity. Vertical scaling boosts the capacity of existing instances, allowing for quicker responses but is limited by hardware and model parallelization capabilities. This paper introduces Themis, a system designed to leverage the benefits of both horizontal and vertical scaling in inference serving systems. Themis employs a two-stage autoscaling strategy: initially using in-place vertical scaling to handle workload surges and then switching to horizontal scaling to optimize resource efficiency once the workload stabilizes. The system profiles the processing latency of deep learning models, calculates queuing delays, and employs different dynamic programming algorithms to solve the joint horizontal and vertical scaling problem optimally based on the workload situation. Extensive evaluations with real-world workload traces demonstrate over 10{$\times$} SLO violation reduction compared to the state-of-the-art horizontal or vertical autoscaling approaches while maintaining resource efficiency when the workload is stable.},
